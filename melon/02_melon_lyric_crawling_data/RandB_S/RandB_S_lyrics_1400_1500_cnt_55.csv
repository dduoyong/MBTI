  Dusty Springfield  ,The Windmills Of Your Mind,Round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel Never ending on beginning on an ever spinning reel Like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream Like the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Keys that jingle in your pocket Words that jangle in your head Why did summer go so quickly Was it something that you said Lovers walk along a shore And leave their footprints in the sand Was the sound of distant drumming Just the fingers of your hand Pictures hanging in a hallway Or the fragment of a song Half remembered names and faces But to whom do they belong When you knew that it was over you Were suddenly aware That the autumn leaves were turning To the color of her hair Like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending on beginning on an ever spinning reel As the images unwind Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind
