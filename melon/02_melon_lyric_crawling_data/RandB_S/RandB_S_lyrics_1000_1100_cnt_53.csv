  Boyz II Men  ,Brokenhearted (Soulpower Mix),Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over I'm young but I'm wise Enough to know that you Don't fall in love overnight That's why I thought if I Took my time that everything In love would be right But as soon as I closed my eyes I was saying to love Goodbye But I guess I'm Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over No more empty conversation Next time I will be totally sure Don't want the pain of falling In and out of love It's more Than my poor heart should endure So I listen to all the advice And remember each time I cry But I guess I'm Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over  so I listen to all the advice And remember each time I cry only brokenhearted Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over Never gonna be alone again That's why I asked you to be My bestfriend boy you know Your always on my mind Think about ya all the time Lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over It's a hurting thing to get over Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted
