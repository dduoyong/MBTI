  Brownstone  ,If You Love Me,"Ooh yeah, yoo hoo... I don't wanna rain on this parade But I'm starting to question the love that was made I'm not looking for just an affair I want a love that is based on truth not just dare You will not hurt my pride If right now you decide That you are not ready to settle down But if you want my heart Then it's time that you start To act like you're mine in the light and the dark If you love me, say it If you trust me, do it If you want me, show it If you need me, prove it If you love me, say it If you trust me, do it If you want me, show it If you need me, prove it You see now actions speak louder than words So don't just say things that I've already heard Don't want your body without your soul I don't want a love who will come here and go You will not hurt my pride If right now you decide That you are not ready to settle down But if you want my heart Then it's time that you start To act like you're mine in the light and the dark If you love me, say it If you trust me, do it If you want me, show it If you need me, prove it If you love me, say it If you trust me, do it If you want me, show it If you need me, prove it If you love me, say it If you trust me, do it If you want me, show it If you need me, prove it Oh baby~ Oh I, Oh I, I wanna touch you baby And spread my love all around you, honey And if you come, you gotta show, baby True love to share... show it prove it say it do it-Oh baby~ Ooh yeah, my sweet baby..."
