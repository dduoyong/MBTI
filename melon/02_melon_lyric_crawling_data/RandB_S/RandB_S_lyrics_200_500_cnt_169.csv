  Koryn Hawthorne  ,Won`t He Do It,"Ooh, oh! Ooh, Lord! Whoa, oooh! Hmm! Ain't nobody stoppin' my shine They try to break me try to take me out But I got Jesus on my side Felt so bad I thought I would die But ain't no power stronger than the one That came and laid down his life And I got mountains to climb But the enemy can't stop me 'Cause there's a calling on my life So, when I'm crying, don't last too long 'Cause he's gon' step in and make it alright Won't He do it? He said He would Fight your battles for you They gon' wonder how you sleep at night Won't He do it? Ah yes, He will Anybody tell you something different You know that's a lie You gon' look back and be so amazed How it turned out It's only His grace Won't He do it? He said He would So, I trust Him at all times I'm about to lose it again I'm about to let them know where I'm from Don't take me there again I just call on Jesus, my friend Get me back in line one more time 'Cause he's always listening Ain't nobody perfect, everybody's hurting I need your whisper Lord, save me from my weaknesses 'Cause you're always on time Come and get your breakthrough 'Cause I'm gonna get mine Won't He do it? He said He would Fight your battles for you They gon' wonder how you sleep at night Won't He do it? Ah yes, He will Anybody tell you something different You know that's a lie You gon' look back and be so amazed How it turned out It's only His grace Won't He do it? He said He would So, I trust Him at all times See what the enemy had planned for my downfall Turned out to be the greatest victory of my life 'Cause when it comes at you fast and hard There's the only one that can come and make it right So, ain't no need for stressing and crying 'Cause he gon' show up just like He did the last time And the last time And the last time I know, I know, I know, I know (Won't he do it?) Won't He do it? He said He would Fight your battles for you They gon' wonder how you sleep at night Won't He do it? Ah yes, He will (yes, He will) Anybody tell you something different You know that's a lie You gon' look back and be so amazed How it turned out It's only His grace Won't He do it? He said He would So, I trust Him at all times Won't he do it? He said he would So, I trust Him at all times All times, all times (won't he do it?

  IASU  ,Children of the Sun,Children of sun / we were all born as one / and our father commands us / that we all dream for our passions. / Is it finally time? / Can our dreams be realized? / So we brandish our wings of wax and finally take flight. But the sun’s too hot / it’s much too hot. / And as though it were all planned / our wings begin to fall apart. / But the sun’s too hot / it’s much too hot. / And we fall / one by one until there’s none. The sun still shines eternally / as it had done before. / And it shines / and it smiles / and it laughs forever more. And it our minds the skies were ours to seize. / The waters ours to drink / and the air for us to breathe. / But they belong to the stars and the sun / and their open invitation / was just a game for fun.
