  Amy Winehouse  ,You Sent Me Flying / Cherry,"Lent you outsiders and my new Badu While you were thinking I didn't have a clue Tough to sort files with your voice in my head So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red And now I feel so small discovering you knew How much more torture would you have put me through You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes And although my pride is not easy to disturb You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb With your battered jeans and your beastie tee Now I can't work like this with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears And I'm not use to this, no, no I observe, yeah, I don't chase So now I sit with consequences, thrust in my face And the melodramas of my day deliver blows That surpass your rejection it just goes to show A simple attraction that reflects right back to me So I'm not as into you as I appear to be And although my pride is not easily disturbed You sent me flying when you kick kicked me to the curb With your battered jeans and your beastie tee Now I can't work like this with you next to me His message was brutal but the delivery was kind Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind It serves to condition me and smoothed my kinks Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect Didn't think you get my number down and such But I never hated myself for my age so much And although my pride is not easy to disturbed You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb So with your battered jeans and your beastie tee Now I can't work like this with you next to me"

  Boyz II Men  ,It`s So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday,How do I say goodbye to what we had? The good times that made us laugh Outweigh the bad  I thought we'd get to see forever But forever's gone away It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  I don't know where this road Is going to lead All I know is where we've been And what we've been through  If we get to see tomorrow I hope it's worth all the wait It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  And I'll take with me the memories To be my sunshine after the rain It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday  And I'll take with me the memories To be my sunshine after the rain It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
