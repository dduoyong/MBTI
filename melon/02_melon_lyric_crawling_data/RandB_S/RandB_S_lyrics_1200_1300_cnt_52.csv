  파마씨 (Pharmacy)  ,그 밤에 우리,그날에 우리 같이 걸었는데 그날에 우리 웃고 있었는데 그 밤에 우리 참 좋았었는데 그 밤에 우린 말이야 아마도 언젠가 저 뻔한 사랑 노래처럼 잊혀지겠지 시간이 지나면 그토록 아름답던 지난 시간들이 왠지 오늘따라 더 그리워져서 습관처럼 난 발끝만 보다 다시 한 번 더 널 생각한다 그날에 우리 손을 잡았는데 그날에 우리 마주 봤었는데 그 밤에 우리 참 행복했는데 그 밤에 우린 말이야 아마도 언젠가 저 뻔한 사랑 노래처럼 잊혀지겠지 시간이 지나면 그토록 아름답던 지난 시간들이 왠지 오늘따라 더 그리워져서 습관처럼 난 발끝만 보다 다시 한 번 더 널 생각한다 이제 와 그날을 돌이켜보면 좋았던 기억들만 남아 아직 널 미워하지 못해 그토록 아름답던 지난 시간들이 왠지 오늘따라 더 그리워져서 습관처럼 난 발끝만 보다 다시 한 번 더 널 생각한다

  Stevie Wonder  ,I Just Called To Say I Love You (Single Version),No New Year's Day to celebrate No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away No first of spring No song to sing In fact here's just another ordinary day No April rain No flower bloom No wedding Saturday within the month of June But what it is is something true Made up of these three words That I must say to you I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart No summer's high No warm July No harvest moon to light one tender August night No autumn breeze No falling leaves Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies No Libra sun No Halloween No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring But what it is though old so new To fill your heart like no three words could ever do I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
