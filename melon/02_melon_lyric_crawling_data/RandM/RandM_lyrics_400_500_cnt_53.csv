  Boz Scaggs  ,We`re All Alone,"Outside the rain begins and it may never end So cry no more on the shore a dream Will take us out to sea Forever more forever more Close your eyes and dream And and you can be with me 'Neath the waves through the caves of hours Long forgotten now We're all alone we're all alone Close the window calm the light And it will be alright No need to bother now Let it out let it all begin Learn how to pretend  Once a story's told It can't help but grow old Roses do lovers too So cast your seasons to the wind And hold me dear oh hold me dear Close the window calm the light And it will be alright No need to bother now Let it out let it all begin All's forgotten now We're all alone oh oh we're all alone Close the window calm the light And it will be alright No need to bother now Let it out let it all begin Owe it to the wind my love  and hold me dear  All's forgotten now,My love We're all alone"
  The Neighbourhood  ,Let It Go,I'm from a little city with expensive taste Where the cars don't run until the engine breaks Wasn't spending pennies on massive things But invested in mess with this recipe Couldn't quite see what the future held And as days went by it would tell itself Let it struggle just a little bit more Let it struggle just a little bit more Remember what the people said Remember what the people said When it's said and done Let it go Remember what the people said Remember what the people said When it's said and done Let it go Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better Just let it go forget it for ever and ever and ever Don't ever resent a letter inside a single word written A little change can play lanes with the right vision Couldn't tell what would happen next But as weeks went by look what turned to best Let it struggle just a little more Let it struggle just a little bit more mhm Remember what the people said Remember what the people said When it's said and done Let it go Remember what the people said Remember what the people said When it's said and done Let it go If what they said was all pretend then it'd be different If it depended on if anyone was listening And I was listening And when they said that what I wanted was a figment I had to turn the other cheek but I was listening Yeah I was listening listening to all Remember what the people said Remember what the people said When it's said and done Let it go Remember what the people said Remember what the people said When it's said and done Let it go Remember what the people said Remember what the people said I wasn't listening I wasn't listening listening at all Remember what the people said Remember what the people said Oh I wasn't listening I wasn't listening listening at all At all At all

  Guillemots  ,Standing On The Last Star,"So, Cinderella sold her soul There's no such thing as rock and roll We all stood in the queue and sold our hearts  I think there was an accident They came as quickly as they went Now I'm half a million miles up in the sky  Standing on the last star Standing on the last star Spinning around  Standing on the last star Standing on the last star Feeling down Trying to find the ground  Don't cry Don't cry I know it'll be alright  I've been trying I've been trying To tell myself that all night  If this is the end of history The final account Nobody to pin your hopes on No money to count Not even lips to say goodbye  Standing on the last star Standing on the last star In the sky  Standing on the last star Standing on the last star There's no decent reason why  Standing on the last star Standing on the last star Waiting to die Somebody left the taps on in the sky  Oh, tell me  Will nothing in the world ever make you happy Will nothing in the world ever make you happy Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy  Will nothing in the world ever make you happy Will nothing in the world ever make you happy Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy  Will nothing in the world ever make you happy Will nothing in the world ever make you happy Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy"
  Palace  ,It`s Over (Acoustic),"Safe to say their love is over It's true I know that life goes on and on The more I've seen my foundations bleeding The weaker I am from my roots to my heart  It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over  I am running out of time Eventually they will both be just fine But father's wept, and my mother's crying I am the middle man and my strength is trying For the best for them, I'll be straight up praying Nothing left now except connections failing  It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over Take me back, it's all I need You are the air that I breathe I am the bullet, you are the gun We are the moon above the sun If we'd be together then you'd take my name If we'd be forever then I'll take the blame I am my father's son right to my bones Stole my mother's eyes in the blue stones  It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over  It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over"

  LINKIN PARK  ,In The End (Live At Milton Keynes),It starts with  One thing I don't know why  It doesn't even matter how hard you try  Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  To explain in due time  All I know  time is a valuable thing  Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  Watch it count down to the end of the day  The clock ticks life away  It's so unreal  Didn't look out below  Watch the time go right out the window  Trying to hold on but didn't even know  Wasted it all just to  Watch you go  I kept everything inside and even though I tried  it all fell apart  What it meant to me  will eventually  be a memory  of a time when I tried  so hard    One thing I don't know why  Doesn't even matter how hard you try  Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  To explain in due time  I tried so hard  In spite of the way you were mocking me  Acting like I was part of your property  Remembering all the times you fought with me  I'm surprised it got so far  Things aren't the way they were before  You wouldn't even recognize me anymore  Not that you knew me back then  But it all comes back to me  In the end  You kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart  What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I  I tried so hard  And got so far  But in the end  It doesn't even matter  I had to fall  And lose it all  But in the end  It doesn't even matter  I put my trust in you  Pushed as far as I can go  And for all this  There's only one thing you should know
  5 Seconds Of Summer  ,The Space Between A Rock And A Hard Place,"Wasted I play the same part Where I'm chasing Your sick little heart 'Til I'm jaded and lying on the floor  Faded I'm wrapped in your arms While you're waiting To tear me apart With a last kiss, you leave me wanting more  You, you're a catch 22 Win or lose, I'm screwed I'm trapped under your spell It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you You're a catch 22 You're a catch 22  Restless I stay awake with the spaces The thought of our hands interlacing It's taking over me  Reckless I'm at your front door And I'm helpless I'm twisted back up in the madness Repeating history  Promise me, you'll never let me leave  You, you're a catch 22 Win or lose, I'm screwed I'm trapped under your spell It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you You're a catch 22 You're a catch 22  Damned if I do, damned if I don't Let me go, I'm better off alone And here we go again  You, you're a catch 22 Win or lose, I'm screwed I'm trapped under your spell It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you You're a catch 22  Win or lose, I'm screwed I'm trapped under your spell It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you You're a catch 22 Win or lose, I'm screwed"
  Maroon 5  ,Misery (Acoustic),"So scared of breaking it But you won't let it bend And I wrote two hundred letters I won't ever send Sometimes it is cut so much Deeper then they seem You'd rather cover up I'd rather let them be So let me be And I'll set you free I am in misery There ain't no other Who can comfort me Why won't you answer me Your silence is slowly killing me Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back Your salty skin and how It mixes in with mine The way it feels to be Completely intertwined It's not that I didn't care It's that I didn't know It's not what I didn't feel, It's what I didn't show So let me be And I'll set you free I am in misery There ain't no other Who can comfort me Why won't you answer me Your silence is slowly killing me Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back Say your faith is shaken You may be mistaken You keep me wide awake Waiting for the sun I'm desperate and confused So far away from you I'm getting there Don't care where I have to run Why do you do what you do to me Why won't you answer me answer me Why do you do what you do to me Why won't you answer me answer me yeah I am in misery There ain't no other Who can comfort me Why won't you answer me Your silence is slowly killing me Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back"
  Bob Dylan  ,Trying To Get To Heaven,"The air is getting hotter, there's a rumblin' in the skies I've been wading through the high muddy water With the heat risin' in my eyes Every day your memory grows dimmer It dosn't haunt me like it did before I've been walking through the mirror to nowhere Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  When I was in Missouri they would not let me be I had to leave there in a hurry I only saw what they let me see You broke a heart that loved you Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore I've been walkin' that lonesome valley Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  People on the platforms, waitin' for the trains I can hear their hearts a-beatin' Like pendulums swinging on chains When you think that you've lost everything You find out you can always lose a little more I'm just goin' down the road feeling bad Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  I'm goin' down the river, down to New Orleans They tell me everything is gonna be all right But I don't know what all right even means I was ridin' in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore I've been all around the world, boys And I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  Gonna sleep down in the parlor and relive my dreams I close my eyes and I wonder If everything is as hollow as it seems Some trains don't pull no gamblers No midnight ramblers, like they did before I've been to sugar town, I shook the sugar down Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door."
  Beirut  ,A Candle`s Fire,"Oh, light a candle's fire, it carries our good name What would you ask a campfire? It scares me just the same And you, you've had it all along An endless need for games Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame  I hit certain from afar, failed to pull my weight But you were light, we traveled through the fall To arrive at our front gate Tonight, we rest beside the fire A smile upon your face Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame  If I had known, that to carry on that way It wouldn't show in the creases on your face If you should go, would you carry on my name? Just let it blow, and the fog will ? Bishop's flame"
  Maximilian Hecker  ,Rose,I can see the daylight And I feel it's right That she's flowing now She's flowing `til it's through A never-ending darkness A never-ending night Now she flies away To walk upon the clouds  Silly laughing when I come home There's just no reason to call I try to leave you to forget you I try to leave you to love you  Can you hear me singing? Can you see me lying Down on the floor Still laughing like a child? My head is full of voices My head is full of lights So please let me go Please let me run away
  Bastille  ,Pompeii (Kat Krazy Remix),"I was left to my own devices  Many days fell away with nothing to show  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  We were caught up and lost in all of our vices  In your pose as the dust settles around us  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  Oh where do we begin?  The rubble or our sins?  Oh where do we begin?  The rubble or our sins?  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?"

I'm but a clean man, stable and alone man  Make it so I won't have to try  The faces always stay the same  So I face the fact that I'm just fine  I said that I'm just fine    I remember, head down,  After you had found out  Manna is a hell of a drug  And I need a little more, I think  Because enough is never quite enough  What's enough?    I took it like a grown man crying on the pavement  Hoping you would show your face  But I haven't heard a thing you've said  In at least a couple hundred days  What'd you say?    I was in the front seat, shaking it out  And I was asking if you felt alright  I never want to hear the truth  I want to hear your voice, it sounded fine  My voice, it sounded fine    I could feel my heartbeat taking me down  And for the moment, I would sleep alright  I'm ? with a selfish fear  To keep me up another restless night  Another restless night    The blood was dry, it was sober  The feeling of audible cracks  And I could tell it was over  From the curtains that hung from your neck    And I realized that then you were perfect  And my teeth ripping out of my head  And it looked like a painting I once knew  Back when my thoughts weren't entirely intact    To pray for what I thought were angels  Ended up being ambulances  And the Lord showed me dreams of my daughter  She was crying inside your stomach    And I felt love again"

  Deep Purple  ,April (Part 1),"April is a cruel time  Even though the sun may shine  And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away  Still falls the April rain  And the valley's filled with pain  And you can't tell me quite why  As I look up to the grey sky  Where it should be blue  Grey sky where I should see you  Ask why, why it should be so  I'll cry, say that I don't know    Baby on-ce in a while I'll forget and I'll smile  But then the feeling comes again of an April without end  Of an April lonely as a girl  In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine  But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun  And the springtime's the season of the night    Grey sky where it should be blue  Grey sky where I should see you  Ask why, why it should be so  I'll cry, say that I don't know  I don't know"

  LINKIN PARK  ,Numb,I'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless lost under the surface Don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes (Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone) Every step I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired so much more aware I've becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  Can't you see that you're smothering me Holding too tightly afraid to lose control Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart right in front of you (Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone) And every second I waste is more than I can take  I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired so much more aware I've becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  And I know I may end up failing too But I know You were just like me with someone disappointed in you  I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired so much more aware I've becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  I've become so numb I can't feel you there (Is everything what you want me to be) I've become so numb I can't feel you there (Is everything what you want me to be)

  FTISLAND (FT아일랜드)  ,The Way Into You,참 길었던 지난 꿈에 희미하게 떠오른 너의 그 모습 그 얼굴이 선명해져서 나는 다시 눈을 감을 수 없었지 잃어버린 시간 그 안에 같은 그리움 안고 살아가 나는 기억해 너의 그 미소를 많은 시간에 바래져 갔지만 나는 기억해 투명한 그 눈빛 아련히 떠올라 다시 볼 수 없겠지만 창을 두드린 바람처럼 행복했던 추억이 다시 찾아와 따뜻한 햇살처럼 날 안아 어루만져 주는 것만 같은 기분 멈춰버린 시간 그 안에 함께한 그 풍경이 떠올라 나는 기억해 너의 그 미소를 많은 시간에 바래져 갔지만 나는 기억해 투명한 그 눈빛 아련히 떠올라 다시 볼 수 없겠지만 내가 찾은 그 모든 건 그건 바로 너의 웃음이었고 너의 웃음 기억할게 그 미소를 가슴에 담을래 나는 기억해 너의 그 모든 걸 많은 시간에 바래져 갔지만 나는 기억해 함께 바랬던 꿈 아련히 가슴에 다시 올 수 없겠지만 I don`t wanna miss you I wanna hold you 너의 그 모습 그 모든 걸 I don`t wanna miss you I want it baby I wanna see you smile I wanna see you smile I wanna see you smile
  John Mayer  ,Comfortable,I just remembered that time at the market Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart And rode down isle 5 You looked behind you to smile back at me Crashed into a rack full of magazines They asked us if we could leave  Can't remember what went wrong last September Thiugh i'm sure that you'd remind me if you had to Our love was comfortable and So broken in I sleep with this new girl i'm still getting used to My friends all approve say she's gonna be good for you They throw me high fives She says the bible is all that she reads And prefers that I not use profanity Your mouth was so dirty Life of the party And she swears that she's artsy But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane Our love was comfortable and So broken in She's perfect so flawless Or so they say hey say  She thinks I can't see the smile that she's fakin' And poses for pictures that are being taken I loved you Grey sweat pants no makeup so perfect Our love was comfortable and So broken in She's perfect so flawless I'm not impressed I want you back
  James Vincent McMorrow  ,"Cavalier (Live At The Theater At The Ace Hotel, Los Angeles)",Speak until the dust settles in the same specific place Light refused to go Drink it from a cast and iron plate instead of cold milk was offered unripe Instead of silence considered craven Nothing made it seem hidden where the aging soil was pure Pressed against the crease Mountains become fragrant at the source how can you stand this exotic angle I read it somewhere that they would lie still I remember how cloth hung flexing with the forest clung Half waist and high raised arms kicking at the slightest form I remember my first love I remember my first love Unrelied I was called missing teeth out of favour Nickel beach it was all gathering by the sundial I woke hard I woke heavy for the half way stop Five whole hours in when I woke hard I woke heavy with the live or parts I remember how cloth hung flexing with the forest clung Half waist and high raised arms kicking at the slightest form I remember my first love I remember my first love I remember my first love
