  Ben Folds Five  ,Sky High,Shattered at dawn So far for so long Feeling newly baptized thinking I don't want this thing to end and All the blue sky Where our stony paths meet Coffee color sheets Looking down at pale knees With a cigarette and the morning beat Under the blue sky Last night at the bar I was wrong I was only hurting And you were acting too polite And we held on to the pain Through the storms and the rain Like a crumpled empty discarded Newports box Ahh under the blue sky Ahh sky high Ahh Pawn shop billboard We Buy Gold Old dreams just fade and twist It's a heartache that never ended The brightness of air Out walking somewhere and when they ask you Just tell them that you knew me back when Under the blue sky Ahh sky high Ahh put on the blue sky Ahh sky high

  Kevin Krauter  ,Full Hand,Sometimes I feel like a guilty pleasure Sometimes it don’t feel like pleasure at all Face in the air like I’m trying to fool ya What a surprise I’m just fooling myself Glued to my phone I’m just trying to hear ya Sweat on the glass burning holes in my hand I don’t wanna believe in a new communion Pour out the wine taste the blood in my breath Till I go and find out It’s so easy Turn and walk away from all the sadness Even if it feels too hard to handle I know it’s just a reason to let it fly Bending my will but the effort is wasted Hung up and dry just a tool in the shed Springing the trap cause it’s testing my patience What a surprise it was all in my head Going to Hell guess they killed me with kindness Drank all my time now I’m eating the chance Is a moment of truth such an inconvenience Peel off the rind bite the fruit in my hands Till I go and find out It’s so easy Turn and walk away from all the sadness Even if it feels too hard to handle I know it’s just a reason to let it fly

  Queen  ,It`s Late (2011 Remaster),You say you love me And I hardly know your name And if I say I love you in the candlelight There`s no one but myself to blame But there`s something inside That`s turning my mind away Oh how I could love you If I could let you stay It`s late but I`m bleeding deep inside It`s late is it just my sickly pride Too late even now the feeling seems to steal away So late though I`m crying I can`t help but hear you say It`s late it`s late it`s late But not too late The way you love me Is the sweetest love around But after all this time The more I`m trying The more I seem to let you down Now you tell me you`re leaving And I just can`t believe it`s true Oh you know that I can love you Though I know I can`t be true Oh you made me love you Don`t tell me that we`re through It`s late but it`s driving me so mad It`s late yes I know but don`t try to tell me that it`s Too late save our love you can`t turn out the lights So late I`ve been wrong but I`ll learn to be right It`s late it`s late it`s late But not too late I`ve been so long You`ve been so long We`ve been so long tryin to work it out I ain`t got long You ain`t got long We gotta know what this life is all about Too late much too late You`re staring at me With suspicion in your eye You say what game are you playing What`s this that you`re saying I know that I can`t reply If I take you tonight Is it making my life a lie Oh you make me wonder Did I live my life alright It`s late but it`s time to set me free It`s late yes i know but there`s no way it has to be Too late so let the fire take our bodies this night So late lat the waters take our guilt in the tide It`s late it`s late it`s late it`s late It`s late it`s late It`s all too late

  Bob Dylan  ,Positively 4Th Street,"You got a lotta nerve To say you are my friend When I was down you just stood there grinning You got a lotta nerve To say you gotta helping hand to lend You just want to be on the side that's winning  You say I let you down You know it's not like that If you're so hurt why then don't you show it You say you've lost your faith But that's not where it's at You have no faith to lose and you know it  I know the reason That you talk behind my back I used to be among the crowd you're in with Do you take me for such a fool To think I'd make contact With the one who tries to hide what it don't know to begin with  You see me on the street You always act surprised You say, How are you Good luck But you don't mean it When you know as well as me You'd rather see me paralyzed Why don't you just come out once and scream it  No, I do not feel that good When I see the heartbreaks you embrace If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them And though I know you're dissatisfied With your position and your place Don't you understand it's not my problem  I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes And for just that one moment I could be you Yes I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes You'd know what a drag it is to see you"

  David Bowie  ,The Width Of A Circle (2015 Remastered Ver.),"In the corner of the morning in the past I would sit and blame the master first and last All the roads were straight and narrow And the prayers were small and yellow And the rumour spread that I was aging fast Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree And I looked and frowned and the monster was me  Well, I said hello and I said hello And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know."" So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN"" So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through For I realized that God's a young man too  So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye"" And I smashed my soul and traded my mind Got laid by a young bordello I was vaguely half asleep For which my reputation swept back home in drag And the moral of this magic spell Negotiates my hide When God did take my logic for a ride (Riding along)  He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again"" (Turn around,go back!)  He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said ""Do it again, do it again"" (Turn around,go back!)  His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said ""Do it again, do it again"" (Turn around, go back!)  Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

  Neil Young  ,Are You Passionate?,"Are you passionate? Are you livin' like you talk? Are you dreamin' now that you're goin' to the top? Are you negative, In a world that never stops, Turnin' on you? Turnin' on me? Turnin' on you?  Are you loving it? Can you ever get enough of it? Is it everything? A love that never stops, Comin' to you? Comin' to me? Comin' to you?  Once I was a soldier, I was fighting in the sky, And the gunfire kept comin' back on me. So I dove into the darkness, And I let my missles fly. And they might be the ones, That kept you free.  Once I was a prisoner, I was riding in a truck, Cleaned up for public display. I looked at those around me, And when they looked at me, I let them see my soul that day.  Are you scared of it? Do you wish that it would stop? Does it bother you when you hear your spirit talk? Well I'm right with you, Yes I'm right with you. It's working on me, It's working on you. It's working on me."

Will you wait for me,  In time,  It`s never my luck,  So I`ll say: never mine.  And i lost a lot of what i  never expect to ever  return  I tend to push it `till the pushing turns from  hurting to burn,  I always take them to the place they always wanted  to go,  Then end up dancing `round  this clown commands,  applause at a show...    Chorus:  I had a dream that you where with me ,  And it wasn`t my fault,  you roll me over,  flipped me over,  like a summer salt.  And that doesn`t happen to me  I`ve never been here before  I saw forever in my never,  And i stood outside her  Heaven  heaven,  inside her heaven,  heaven    And i could only dream of you and sleep,  but i won`t see sunlight again,  i can try to be with you , but some how i`ll end up just losing a friend,  And i can only reach for you  relate to you,  I`m losing my friend...  Where did she go?  where?    Chorus:  I had a dream that you where with me ,  And it wasn`t my fault,  you roll me over,  flipped me over,  like a summer salt.  And that doesn`t happen to me  I`ve never been here before  I saw forever in my never,  And i stood outside her  Heaven  I stood outside her heaven(3x)    Will you let me into your heaven?"
  Crossfade  ,Starless,If only you could watch me fall I cannot feel it anymore The soul you cut the soul you adore Cannot feel you anymore Cause you've run through me with the destructive force I think somehow I gotta see it straight I gotta get you out of me But I cannot get through to you  See me I'm down and I get deeper with every breath See me I'm over the edge farther with every step See me I'm down and I get deeper with every breath Standing over the edge I'm taking my last breath  How I feel like I'm starless I'm ready to fade now And how I feel like I'm starless I'm hopeless and grayed out Somehow I feel like I'm starless I'm ready to fade now And now I feel like I'm starless I'm ready to burn out  I can transcend you and mentally bend you But I can't handle the shit that I'm into I have been blinded and always reminded Of the things I've wanted but I never could find I am a part of a world that I hate I wish the End would come faster my world's a disaster Can't you see that I;m down and I'm drowning And I can't keep my head above my wake  I gotta get you out of my veins I gotta get you out of my blood I gotta get you out of my scene I gotta get you out of me  What I'm really trying hard to get down to words Is the way I fit into this world Things I survived pushed me to the darkeer side Because of life as it was the life that was Yours should've never been mine But I never could take anymore of this Cause I'm always gonna get down to the floor It's a cold gun that I kiss 'Cause I cannot break anymore  Somehow I feel like I'm starless I'm ready to fade now That's how I feel when I'm starless I'm hopeless and grayed out Somehow I feel like I'm starless I'm ready to burn out oh Now I'm starless

  Fanfarlo  ,Comets,"Look up, open the clouds Here comes the bombshell On the way home…  And now we want the coal? Confusing times  Cry murder, cry what you like Just let the comets lead the way  We’ll tear it down We’ll hold the truth by the neck Kick in the doors and burn the books Try to forget  And wear it like flag Try to be patient On the way home  Cause inside, behind every curtain They count the minutes, they count the days  We’ll tear it down We’ll hold the truth by the neck Kick in the doors and burn the books Try to forget  If you look at the horizon there is always something ducking out of sight When you’re looking at the treetops and they’re scratching out their patterns in the sky  Look up, open the clouds Here comes the bombshell On the way home…"
  Santana  ,Samba Pa Ti,"Samba Pa Ti is a song that I wrote when we came back from Europe the very first time. I was up in my room looking out my window because I heard this sound. This cat blew a couple of notes on the saxophone in the back of the alley.  And when I looked out, he was trying to stay up on his feet. It looked like the whole world was moving around him. And he was trying to decide between putting his saxophone in his mouth and putting the bottle of booze from his back pocket into his mouth.  And I thought ""he is a prisoner."" He didn't know what to put in his mouth next - the horn or the bottle of booze, you know. And it just hit me. It really broke me down because he looked like all of us at one time or another.  And for some reason, i just heard these lyrics, ""through every step in life you find freedom from within."" And then I heard the melody.  It was one of the first songs that I felt really free, free enough to forget about anything. You just let it flow through you. And even though it's very simple, there's still a lot of emotion in it."
