"  Crosby, Stills & Nash  ",Lady Of The Island,"Holding you close undisturbed before a fire The pressure in my chest when you breathe in my ear We both knew this would happen when you first appeared My lady of the island  The brownness of your body in the fireglow Except the places where the sun refused to go Our bodies were a perfect fit in afterglow we lay My lady of the island  Letting myself wander through the world inside your eyes You know I'd like to stay here until every tear runs dry Do, do, do, do, do, do, do ... My lady of the island  Wrapped around each other in the peeping sun Beams of sunshine light the stage the red light's on I never want to finish what I've just begun with you My lady of the island  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do..."

  김경호  ,사랑이 들린다면,I love 그 말만으론 표현 못하겠지만 난 그저 함께 있는 이유로 행복 했단 걸 알아 With you 여전히 내게 달콤한 추억 속에 날 스쳐 지나갔던 그 많은 시간들을 기억해 I say 기다렸다고 지금 우리 모습을 난 몇 번이나 되뇌어 봤어 시간이 멈추기를 You know 말을 안 해도 너의 눈을 보면서 우린 서로 같은 시간을 함께 걷고 있다고 이 노래가 들린다면 이대로 둘이서 잠든 널 보며 말해줄게 사랑한다고 사랑한다고 내 사랑이 들린다면 영원히 둘이서 이젠 Stay Together 이대로 내게 와 When I look in your eyes 너의 눈물이 흐를 땐 맘껏 울어도 돼 내 품에 잠든 널 바라 볼 테니 I say 기다렸다고 지금 우리 모습을 난 몇 번이나 되뇌어 봤어 시간이 멈추기를 You know 말을 안해도 너의 눈을 보면서 우린 서로 같은 시간을 함께 걷고 있다고 이 노래가 끝난대도 내 곁에 있어줘 잠든 날 보며 말해줄래 사랑한다고 사랑한다고 이 세상이 멈춘대도 내 안에 있어줘 이젠 Stay Together 너에게 다가가 날 위해 기다려 주던 날 위해 지켜봐 주던 날 위해 사랑을 주던 널 이 노래가 들린다면 이대로 둘이서 잠든 널 보며 말해줄게 사랑한다고 사랑한다고 내 사랑이 들린다면 영원히 둘이서 이젠 Stay Together 이대로 내게 와 When I look in your eyes 너의 눈물이 흐를 땐 맘껏 울어도 돼 내 품에 잠든 널 바라 볼 테니
  Saosin  ,You`re Not Alone (Radio Edit),It's just like him To wander off in the evergreen park Slowly searching for any sign Of the ones he used to love He says he's got nothing left to live for He says he's got nothing left And this time I think you'll know You're not alone There is more to this I know You can make it out You will live to tell She's just like him Spoiled rotten Confused by the lies she's been fed And she's searching for no one But herself Her eyes turn to green and she seems to be happy That she is here And this time I think you'll know You're not alone There is more to this I know You can make it out You will live to tell You're not alone There is more to this I know You can make it out There is more to know We're not alone There is more to this I know You can make it out You will live to tell So tell me You're not alone There is more to this I know You can make it out Make it out You will live to tell Live to tell You're not alone There is more to this I know And I know You can make it out You will live to tell

  Iggy Pop  ,American Valhalla,"I have no plans, I have no debts The mind is not the carefree set I'm looking for American Valhalla So if it passes by give me a holler Please  I've shot my gun, I've used my knife This hasn't been an easy life I'm hoping for American Valhalla But if I have outlived my use Please drink my juice  Innocence It's so hard to figure it out Innocence It's so hard to figure it out I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know It's so hard to figure it out I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know  Where is American Valhalla Death is the pill that's tough to swallow Is there anybody in there Who do I have to kill I'm not the man with everything I've nothing, but my name  Lowly, lowly deeds That no one sees Lowly, lowly deeds That no one sees  Where is American Valhalla Death is the pill that's hard to swallow Is anybody in there And can I bring a friend I'm not the man with everything I've nothing, but my name I've nothing, but my name I've nothing, but my name I've nothing, but my name I've nothing, but my name"
  Iron Maiden  ,2 Minutes To Midnight,"Kill for gain or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason The Golden Goose is on the loose And never out of season Blackened pride still burns inside This shell of bloody treason Here's my gun for a barrel of fun For the love of living death  The killer's breed or the Demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore  2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom. 2 minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb.  The blind men shout Let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers. The napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.  The killer's breed or the Demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore.  2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom. 2 minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb.  The body bags and little rags of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.  The killer's breed or the Demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore.  2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom. 2 minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb.  Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night  Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night"
  Yellowcard  ,Two Weeks From Twenty,Jimmy wasn't really popular He had a couple of friends back home And sooner or later they're all getting out so he had to join up alone He was dreaming of the ivory league since he was only three feet tall And get the hell out of jersey and then he would never look back at all And then your heroes say That miles away We lost another one that we sent with a gun They're gonna miss him he was two weeks from twenty and there's still no shame From the man to blame Jimmy never had a reason to stay Cos all the factories shut down All he had was a line for his name So he could sign away his right to be proud He tried to kiss her on the way out the door She just put her little hand on his face I don't understand why you're leaving she said But I hope your gonna ask me to wait And then your heroes say That miles away We lost another one that we sent with a gun His lady missed him he was two weeks from twenty and there's still no shame From the man to blame  Jimmy's mother went to Capitol Hill So she could fill her heart up with joy Maybe shake a few hands while she's there and tell them thank you sir for taking my boy And then your heroes say That miles away We lost another one that we sent with a gun His mama missed him he was two weeks from twenty and there's still no shame From the man to blame No there's still no shame And we're all to blame We're all to blame We're all to blame We're all to blame We're all to blame
  Electric Light Orchestra  ,Last Train To London,"It was 9-29,9-29 back street big city.  The sun was going' down,there was music all around  It felt so right.    It was one of those nights,one of those nights when  you feel the world stop turnin',you were standing  There,there was music in the air.I should have been  Away,but I knew I'd have to stay.    CHORUS    Last train to London,just headin' out,  Last train to London,just leavin' town.  But I really want tonight to last forever  I really wanna be with you.  Let the music play on down the line tonight.    It was one of those nights,one of those nights when  You feel the fire is burnin',everybody was there,  Everybody to share,it felt so right.    There you were on your own,lookin' like you were  The only one around,I had to be with you,  Nothin' else that I could do,  I should have been away,but I knew I'd have to say.    Repeat Chorus    Underneath a starry sky,time was still but hours  Must really have rushed by,I didn't realize  But love was in your eyes I really should have  Gone,but love went on and on...    Repeat Chorus"
