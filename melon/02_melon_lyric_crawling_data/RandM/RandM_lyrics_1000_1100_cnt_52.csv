  The Verve  ,Gravity Grave [Live Glastonbury 93],"Get back, get back again and again I've been here since I can remember when My life is a boat, being blown by you With nothing ahead, just the deepest blue...  To me you're like a setting sun You rise then you're gone To me you're like a setting sun You rise then you're gone  Come back, come back again and again, I've been here since I can remember when The world just spins whilst mine stands still Nothing's changed in your gravity grave  To me you're like a setting sun You rise then you're gone To me you're like a setting sun You shine then you're gone  To me you're like a setting sun You shine then you're gone To me you're like a setting sun You shine then you're gone Go down on your light So bright it burns my eyes Sounds like a perfect way To end my life To me you're like a setting sun... To me you're like a setting sun...  ------------- Lyrics Powered by LyricFind Written By JONES, SIMON/SALISBURY, PETER/MC CABE, NICK Lyrics © EMI Music Publishing"
  LP  ,Muddy Waters,"We are kneeling at the rivers edge and tempting All the steps to follow closer right behind Is it only when you feel a part is empty That it's gnawing at the corners of your mind  I will ask you for mercy I will come to you blind What you'll see is the worst me Not the last of my kind  In the muddy water we're falling In the muddy water we're crawling Holds me down Hold me now Sold me out In the muddy waters we're falling  It is not clear why we choose the fire pathway Where we end is not the way that we had planned All the spirits gather 'round like its our last day To get across you know we'll have to raise the sand  Oooh, I will ask you for mercy I will come to you blind What you'll see is the worst me I'm not the last of my kind  In the muddy water we're falling In the muddy water we're crawling Holds me down Hold me now Sold me out In the muddy waters we're falling  Don't fail me now Put your arms around me and pull me out I know I'm found With your arms around me, oh save me now  In the muddy water we're falling In the muddy water we're crawling Holds me down Hold me now Sold me out In the muddy waters we're falling"
  Limp Bizkit  ,Don`t Go Off Wandering,"Everyday is nothing but stress to me I'm constantly dwelling on how you got the best of me Wanna know something I can't believe The way you keep testing me and mentally molesting me Would you think any less of me if I said that I'd be there Would you think any less of me if I said I really cared Of course you would 'cause you only want what you can't have As for me I'm stuck with my dick in my hand because  Chorus You don't feel nothing at all You don't feel nothing at all  Verse 2 Maybe there's more to life than it seems I'm constantly running from reality chasing dreams Wanna know something I can't believe Just how much misery comes with humility Do you think any less of me now that I'm gone Look at me now, everything is gone I can't seem to do anything right But I figured out why you don't let me inside because  Chorus You don't feel nothing at all You don't feel nothing at all  Bridge You need nothing from me now So you think I'm useless to you now But I need one thing from you now I insist that you feel me now You said you needed me, you said, you said You said you needed me, you said, you said You said, you said You said, you said  Chorus You don't feel nothing at all You don't feel nothing at all"

  Skid Row  ,Slave To The Grind,She caught the melting sky It burned but still the winter passes by and by to the other side A slow parade of wind that blows through trees that wilted With the season's children Are we saved by the words of bastard saints Do we live in fear or faith Tell me now who's behind the rain  A maze of tangled grace The symptoms of for real are crumbling from embrace But still we chase the shadows of belief And new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls Are we ashamed of our own fate Or play the fool for our own sake Tell me who's behind the rain What do we need where do we go when we get where we don't know Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow When faith's our shelter from the cold  What do we need where do we go when we get where we don't know Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow When faith's our shelter from the cold Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away away Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away Quicksand Jesus I need you Quicksand Jesus I believe you Quicksand I'm so far away

Can I carry that cross for you? Can I carry that cross for you? Is there anything that I need to know? Did you let me down? Did you let me down? Why why why - did you let me down?  Did you think I wouldn't know Why why why - did you let me down?  I wanna sit right here, I'm gonna write you a letter I wanna sail, I wanna sail over the ocean I wanna talk to Best and Muhammad Ali I don't just use my fists, yeah I use my feet They got spirit, I got spirit Oh mama mama mama it's like yellow earth What was it like for you when you was giving birth You got it in for you, I got it in for me I said, why you always jump in places like Stevie Mc Queen?

  버즈  ,척,대체 뭐가 그리 그리워서 아팠는지 이젠 기억조차도 전혀 남아있지 않아 남 얘기를 하듯 네 추억에 등 돌려 무거워진 마음은 잠시 기분 탓이야 행복해서 미안해 나만 생각하려해 날 타이르듯 되뇌어 보지만 oh 가져가 지독한 그리움 기억 속 널 다시 데려가 난 아무렇지 않은 척 애를 써도 또다시 울컥하고 말아 아직도 난 사람 마음이 참 생각처럼 되질 않아 쓴웃음에 한 번 더 미련을 삼켜 보곤 해 미워하고 싶은데 그것조차 잘 안돼 너의 기억은 너무나 찬란해 잠 못 들게 해 가져가 지독한 그리움 기억 속 널 다시 데려가 난 아무렇지 않은 척 애를 써도 또다시 울컥하고 말아 넌 어떻게 나를 잊었던 거니 대답 없는 질문만 길어져가 여전히 거울 속 표정엔 그리운 그대가 있는 걸 난 아무렇지 않은 척 더 애를 써봐도 또다시 울컥하고 말아 아직도 난
  Arch Enemy  ,Burning Bridges,"4. Silverwing  Fly with me on a starlit sky I'll set you free... Yes, it can be A dream unchased is a life at waste Never let them conquer your pride Our love is warm here Like the image of a distant sun This star will always shine And never, ever fade away  Fly on... Silverwing Fly with me... Stay free... Silverwing  Seeking truths in spirit skies Which one of you will guide me tonight? The milky way tastes sour, Has heaven lost its power? So let us set sail on this sea of dreams The moon gets lost in the morning sun Just let the spinning wheel spin And let your life begin"
