  Soren Juul  ,Dear Child,"On the surface of it Not sure what that is The words are not scratched And the room lit Maybe I should stay for a while And maybe there's a chance we'll be stopped from the time Until the next plane comes And takes me away  Sometimes it's hard to get Feels like it's catch or miss And all the stories told With all the love they know  Waiting for something Not sure what that is Wish for my thoughts May they rest in peace Just for this time Might just spend my time in a foreign space A ghost in the wall still keeps me awake All through the night  Sometimes it's hard to get Feels like it's catch or miss And all the stories told With all the love they know  Standing to sit here almost alone Listening to records, still no one on the phone Safe in song Feel like I've waited, most So sooner or later I'd earn my wings And I'd find that way home  Sometimes it's hard to get Feels like it's catch or miss I see your innocence And give you compliments Sometimes it's hard to get Feels like it's catch or miss And all the stories told With all the love they know"
  Bell X1  ,"Eve, The Apple Of My Eye","You left it, I sent it I want it back You left it, I sent it I want it back  If I had you here, I'd clip your wings Snap you up and leave you sprawling on my pin This plan of mine is oh so very lame Can't you see the grass is greener where it rains  You left, I died, I went and you cried You came, I think But I never really know I've served my time I've watched you climb The wrong incline But what do I know  Accept it, Don't let it Turn the screw Accept it, And let it Scream back at you  Now this applies both equally to you and I The only thing we share Is the same sky These empty metaphors They're all in vain Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains  In the garden Snake was a charmin' And Eve said let's give it a try Now lead us not into temptation But no matter how hard I try When in the garden and Snake is a charmin' And Eve says let's give it a try Eve is the apple of my eye  And I lie behind you And a cradle you in the palm of me And I pat your hair down I think will we sink or swim? 'Cause we could do either on a whim"

  Quella Vecchia Locanda  ,Villa Doria Pamphili,"Scender sulla terra, Quando intrisa di rugiada, Puoi porgere le mani verso lei. Aspettar che il vento Porti giù tutte le stelle E circondar quel cuore che le attende. Scricchiolar le foglie, Confondersi nell'aria, Tra i gemiti di un canto nascerà.  Dolce l'armonia, Con la natura gioca, Si innalza per poi scivolar sui prati. Vibra in noi la gioia Per l'attimo ineguale, In quel fragore tutta la sua gloria. Grido mi risponde, Volando su quell'ala E in tuffo tu il tuo nido mi aprirai."

  Sky Sailing  ,Explorers (Album Version),"This old mountain side  Where we used to reside  Is slowly recalling  The things we discovered inside    Oh the crystal caves    We shed both our jackets  And I hammered brackets  From old metal chairs  To the walls, a crude set of stairs    To lead us down    And you tied a rope  To the steepening slope  A jerry rigged harness  So we could descend in the dark    But the tide came in    And we found ourselves in the sea  Deep under water  We both found that we could still breathe  So we spent the day submerged    And we swam the evening away    [Musical break]    The water was clear  Like the pure atmosphere  As we kicked and fluttered  Through caverns all cluttered with age    In the afterglow    We swim hand and hand  Over white satin sand  And you left a ribbon  To honor the pale gibbon moon    But that was years ago    And we never came up for air  Down there  We can go anywhere    The old world was dying  While we took our flying  Like peregrine falcons  Beneath the transparent blue waves    Far below the surf    And we spent the hours  With submarine flowers  I knew I'd remember  That day in November  As we  Felt alive again    Cuz we found ourselves in the sea  Deep underwater  We both found that we could still breathe  So we spent the day submerged  And we swam the evening away  We swam the evening away"

  Ben Folds  ,Songs Of Love,"Pale, pubescent beasts, roam through the streets  And coffee-shops, their prey gather in herds  Of stiff knee-length skirts, and white ankle-socks  But while they search for a mate, my type hibernate  In bedrooms above, composing their songs of love    Young, uniform minds, in uniform lines  And uniform ties, run round with trousers on fire  And signs of desire, they cannot disguise,  While I try to find words, as light as the birds  That circle above, to put in my songs of love    Fate doesn`t hang, on a wrong or right choice  Fortune depends, on the tone of your voice  So sing while you have time, let the sun shine down from above  And fill you with songs of love    Fate doesn`t hang, on a wrong or right choice  Fortune depends, on the tone of your voice  So let`s sing while we still can, while the sun hangs high up above  Wonderful songs of love, beautiful songs of love"
