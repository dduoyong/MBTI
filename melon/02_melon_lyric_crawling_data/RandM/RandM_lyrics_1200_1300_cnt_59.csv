  김경호  ,Survival Game,can't beat the speed of light No time to take a break Don't wanna get behind everyone of you Can't keep the place in line But never let you in Survival game has just begun No need a help from you No time to care about you Don't need nobody to push me to the top Gotta take a chance on me Gotta pull somebody out To stay alive in real game Up above my head only sky is the limit Raise my power now Feel my heart beating see my eyes on fire Have no fear to dare Get ready for your life It's rougher than you think You are surrounded by those who want your place You gotta kick their asses You have to be stronger Since you were born You're in this World of pain you'll never getaway sometimes I fall and sometimes I will rise I keep my strength to the end Sometimes I'm a human sometimes I'm beast I'm the one who will survive Up above my head only sky is the limit Raise my power now Feel my heart beating see my eyes on fire Have no fear to dare I cry I weep I want to slow it down I need somebody to take care of me But lies and hate killed my trust in you it just makes me to go alone Go go go for what you need to get Run run run to het to the place you'd like Don't don't don't look at the one beside you You just go straight to the top can't beat the speed of light No time to take a break Don't wanna get behind everyone of you Can't keep the place in line But never let you in Survival game has just begun No need a help from you No time to care about you Don't need nobody to push me to the top Gotta take a chance on me Gotta pull somebody out To stay alive in real game Up above my head only sky is the limit Raise my power now Feel my heart beating see my eyes on fire I'm the only one who has victory in this survival game
  Gabrielle Aplin  ,Light Up The Dark,"Saw you staring into nothing In the silence something's screaming I know you're trying but there's nothing you can say I feel better in the morning When all my troubles lose their meaning Let go, there's nothing you can change I know it hurts to watch me bleeding Can't tell you what I'm needing We can't stop the river rising I got a heavy heart Too much for you to hold We always come apart And then I treat you so cold We can pretend there's nothing wrong but I was telling you it's not your fault You wanna help but it's helpless every time We're bittersweet in the sunlight We can't believe every story we're sold There's truth in the darkness we find I know it hurts to watch me bleeding Can't tell you what I'm needing We can't stop the river rising I got a heavy heart Too much for you to hold We always come apart And I treat you so cold The chemicals that we are breathing Lock you out and I keep looking in I am running out of reasons Don't help myself by looking in And I'm standing in the way And I'm standing in the way I got a heavy heart Too much for you to hold We always come apart And I then I treat you so cold I treat you so cold"
  Aztec Camera  ,All I Need Is Everything,"Tears, just like the jewels Adorn their corporate crown, Weigh on me worthless and I Shake them down and leave now, And have no royal things.  You, would consecrate the ground, I paced in pain, And though those pavements Caught your sorrow stains. They fall from me and I say, Maybe don't fall for anything That says it's never gonna Give you everything.  I wish myself into your arms To know that all I need is everything.  The size of the sea, and the sun in my eyes And the line in my head, Yearning for more, only for more. These days are as bright as the days I have seen In the wildest of dreams, Yearning for more, only for more.  I wish myself into your arms To know that all I need is everything.  Hold back the night, I am tired of my sight That won't see anymore, More than today, threatening to stay.  Hold back the night, I am tired of my sight That won't see anymore, ""Show me you care,"" is ""Show me the door."""
  Teen Suicide  ,Cop Graveyard,"You don't have to give me head Just let me sleep in your bed Locked graves along the road When we pass, we roll the windows down When I'm there with you at night I pretend like we've never been alive  Bridge And I get away with it for a while  Verse 2 Hiding in the restaurant Avoiding calls from your mom"
  Mark Eitzel  ,Snowbird,Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean The unborn grass lies waiting For its coat to turn to green The snowbird sings the song he always sings And speaks to me of flowers That will bloom again in spring  When I was young my heart was young then too Anything that it would tell me That's the thing that I would do But now I feel such emptiness within For the thing that I want most in life's The thing thing that I can't win  Spread your tiny wings and fly away And take the snow back with you Where it came from on that day The one I love forever is untrue And if I could you know that I would Fly away with you  The breeze along the river seems to say That he'll only break me heart again Should I decide to stay So little snowbird take me with you When you go To that land of gentle breezes Where the peaceful waters flow  Spread your tiny wings and fly away And take the snow back with you Where it came from on that day The one I love forever is untrue And if I could you know that I would Fly away with you

  Oasis  ,Idlers Dream,My heart it skips a beat when I behold The light that's shining through your eyes of gold From heavenly blood you seem to spring From heavenly waters you can drink  I'll meet you on a day that never ends I'll greet you in a way that heaven meant You lay me down gently on the leaves You cover me over in my sleep  I never did say that I wish I could I never could pray 'cause it's just no good I hope you don't break my heart of stone I don't want to scream out loud  And wake up on my own And as I close my eyes And the sky turns red I realize just what you are  You're an idler's dream And you're singing Shangri-La  Shangri-La Shangri-La Shangri-La

  Al Stewart  ,The Palace Of Versailles,The wands of smoke are rising From the walls of the Bastille And through the streets of Paris Runs a sense of the unreal The Kings have all departed There servants are nowhere We burned out their mansions In the name of Robespierre And still we wait To see the day begin Our time is wasting in the wind Wondering why Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles  Inside the midnight councils The lamps are burning low On you sit and talk all through the night But there's just no place to go And Bonaparte is coming With his army from the south Marat your days are numbered And we live hand to mouth While we wait To see the day begin Our time is wasting in the wind Wondering why Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles  The ghost of revolution Still prowls the Paris streets Down all the restless centuries It wonders incomplete It speaks inside the cheap red wine Of cafe summer nights Its red and amber voices Call the cars at traffic lights Why do you wait To see the day begin Your time is wasting in the wind Wondering why Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles

  Liam Gallagher  ,Once,It was easier to have fun back when we had nothing Nothing much to manage Back when we were damaged Sometimes the freedom we wanted feels so uncool Just clean the pool Send the kids to school But oh I remember how you used to shine Back then You went down so easy like a glass of wine My friend When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again But it turns out You only get to do it once I think it's true what they say that the dream is borrowed You give it back tomorrow Minus the sorrow And the pain she just comes in to break up the daydream And I felt his waving To keep from feeling the same thing But oh l remember how you used to shine Back then You went down so easy like a glass of wine My friend When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again But it turns out You only get to do it once You only get to do it once You only get to do it once You only get to do it once But oh I remember how you used to shine Back then You went down so easy like a glass of wine My friend When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again But you were wrong You only get to do it once
