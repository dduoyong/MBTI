  Ron Sexsmith  ,Thinking Out Loud,"Thinking out loud Is all I'm doing Trying to raise my love Above the ruins  With each song I kick it around, Thinking... My love I can tell  There's a load on your mind If we poured ourselves Like this bottle of wine And let it flow,  We'll figure it out Thinking out loud But it's hard to think with all the racket Going on inside our heads  All this worrying is getting us nowhere Let's go somewhere instead Just thinking out loud Is it all we're good for?  Trying to raise our love But always falling short Heaven knows What it's all about  Thinking out loud With each song I kick it around Thinking out loud"

  Guns N` Roses  ,Madagascar,I won't be told anymore That I've been brought down in this storm And left so far out from the shore That I can't find my way back my way anymore Oh no I won't be told anymore That I've been brought down in this storm And left so far out from the shore Oh that I can't find my way back my way anymore Oh no I  Forgive them that tear down my soul Bless them that they might grow old And free them so that they may know That it's never too late For the many times what seemed like a memory I've searched and found the ways you used to lure me in I found the way oh why it had to be Mired in denial and so afraid If we ever find it's true That we have the strength to choose Our freedom or the chains We held together  I'm gonna tell you a story Stand up for righteousness What Stand up for justice What Stand up for truth How can a person grow up with all this around them You got to call on that something Where does it come from That can make a way out of no way All this hatred What we've got here is Fear That power that can make a way out of now no way Failure to communicate I tell ya I seen the lightning I've heard the thunder roll Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we do Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than we even know Sometimes Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with I feel discouraged It gets taught Sometimes I feel discouraged I felt this fear He promised never to leave me never to leave me alone no never alone no never alone Let's get something straight alright Promised never to leave me This whole thing was fucked up Never to leave me alone All men betray All lose heart I don't want to lose heart I want to believe Together at the table of brotherhood I have a dream Free at last Free at last Thank God almighty WE ARE FREE AT LAST I won't be told anymore That I've been brought down in this storm And left so far out from the shore That I can't find my way back my way anymore Oh no I won't be told anymore That I've been brought down in this storm And left so far out from the shore That I can't find my way back my way anymore
  Feist  ,My Moon My Man (Grizzly Bear Remix),"My moon, my man So changeable and Such a loveable lamb to me My care, my coat Leave on a high note There's nowhere to go but on Heart on my sleeve Not where it should be The song's out of key again My moon's white face What day and what phase It's the calendar page again Take it slow Take it easy on me And shed some light Shed some light on me please Take it slow Take it easy on me And shed some light Shed some light on me please My moon and me Not as good as we've been It's the dirtiest clean I know My care, my coat Leave on a high note There's nowhere to go There's nowhere to go Take it slow Take it easy on me And shed some light Shed some light on me please Take it slow Take it easy on me And shed some light Shed some light on me please My moon my moon my man My moon my moon my man My moon my moon my man My moon my moon my man"
