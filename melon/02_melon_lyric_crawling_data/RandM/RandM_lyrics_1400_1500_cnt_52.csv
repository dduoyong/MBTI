  The Beatles  ,She's Leaving Home (Remastered 2009),Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins Silently closing her bedroom door Leaving the note that she hoped would say more She goes down stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief Quietly turning the backdoor key Stepping outside she is free She We gave her most of our lives Is leaving Sacrificed most of our lives Home We gave her everything money could buy She's leaving home after living alone For so many years Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown Picks up the letter that's lying there Standing alone at the top of the stairs She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our baby's gone Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly How could she do this to me She We never thought of ourselves Is leaving Never a thought for ourselves Home We struggled hard all our lives to get by She's leaving home after living alone For so many years Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away Waiting to keep the appointment she made Meeting a man from the motor trade She What did we do that was wrong Is having We didn't know it was wrong Fun Fun is the one thing that money can't buy Something inside that was always denied For so many years She's leaving home Bye bye

  더 넛츠 (The NuTs)  ,어느새 눈물만,그녀의 한마디에 백번은 웃고 그 몸짓에 백번쯤은 울기도 했죠 사랑이 내게 시작되던 그 순간부터 나는 없던걸요  언젠간 헤어짐이 올꺼라 해도 이번만은 아니기를 간절히 빌죠 미안해 말만 남겨둔체 떠나간 그대 모른체로 잊으체로 살라죠  다시 그대를 만나면 웃으며 보내도 가슴만큼은 마음만큼은 또 참아요 다시 한숨만 나와도 그댈 위해 어느새 눈물만 훔쳐요 (Chorus 그댈 사랑하니까)  헤어질 이유들이 천개라 해도 사랑할 수 밖에 이유는 하나 그대를 향한 마음처럼 발걸음 또한 고장난 듯 어느샌가 향해요  다시 그대를 만나면 웃으며 보내도 가슴만큼은 마음만큼은 또 참아요 다시 한숨만 나와도 그댈 위해 어느새 눈물만 훔쳐요  그대보다 더 많이 첨부터 언제나 더 많이 사랑한 잘못이니깐 지운척 또 지울께요  그댈 사랑해 사랑해 외치고 외쳐도 기억속에서 추억속에서 또 막아요 입에 맴돌던 말들을 숨긴체로 어느새 눈물만  다시 그대를 만나면 웃으며 보내도 가슴만큼은 마음만큼은 또 참아요 다시 한숨만 나와도 그댈 위해 어느새 눈물만 훔쳐요
