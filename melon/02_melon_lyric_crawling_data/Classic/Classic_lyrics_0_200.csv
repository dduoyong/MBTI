  AWESOME (어썸)  ,"IL MONDO (Sung by 길병민, 유채훈, 한기주) (‘팬텀싱어 3’ 유채훈 가창곡)",No stanotte amore Non ho piu pensato a te Ho aperto gli occhi Per guardare intorno a me E intorno a me Girava il mondo come sempre Gira il mondo gira Nello spazio senza fine Con gli amori appena nati Con gli amori gia finiti Con la gioia e col dolore della gente come me Un mondo Soltanto adesso io ti guardo Nel tuo silenzio io mi perdo E sono niente accanto a te Il mondo Non si e fermato mai un momento La notte insegue sempre il giorno Ed il giorno verra No stanotte amore Non ho piu pensato a te Ho aperto gli occhi Per guardare intorno a me E intorno a me Girava il mondo come sempre Gira il mondo gira Nello spazio senza fine Con gli amori appena nati Con gli amori gia finiti Con la gioia e col dolore della gente come me Un mondo Soltanto adesso io ti guardo Nel tuo silenzio io mi perdo E sono niente accanto a te Il mondo Non si e fermato mai un momento La notte insegue sempre il giorno Ed il giorno verra Un mondo Soltanto adesso io ti guardo Nel tuo silenzio io mi perdo E sono niente accanto a te Il mondo Non si e fermato mai un momento La notte insegue sempre il giorno Ed il giorno verra
  Lesley Garrett  ,Lloyd-Webber : The Phantom Of The Opera - Think Of Me,"Think of me, think of me fondly When we've said goodbye Remember me once in a while Please promise me, you'll try When you'll find that once again you long To take your heart back and be free If you'll ever find a moment Spare a thought for me We never said our love was evergreen Or as unchanging as the sea But if you can still remember Stop and think of me Think of all the things We've shared and seen Don't think about the way Things might have been Think of me, think of me waking Silent and resigned Imagine me trying too hard To put you from my mind Recall those days, look back on all those times Think of those things we'll never do There will never be a day When I won't think of you Long ago, it seems so long ago How young and innocent we were She may not remember me But I remember her Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade They have their seasons, so do we But please promise me that sometimes You will think of me"
  The Dark Tenor  ,River Flows On The Edge (Feat. 이루마),"The time has come To let all your fears pass by Your no man's land Has turned to what you stand for Welcome to your new life In eternal sunlight Spread your wings to new heights Only you will decide what is next to become On the edge, On the edge Lost days have gone With all your pain left inside Your daydreams have Turned to what you stand for Welcome to your new life In eternal sunlight Spread your wings to new heights Only you will decide what is next to become On the edge, On the edge"
