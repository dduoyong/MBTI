  Sharleen Spiteri  ,The Sound Of Silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence Fools said I, You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whisper'd in the sounds of silence"

  Eric Benet  ,Cracks Of My Broken Heart,Maybe we need just a little more time Time that can heal what's been on your mind You can find what we've lost before it all slips away We need time to mend from the mistakes I've made God only knows what a heart can survive So many tears from all the pain in our lives And where else could we go after all we've been through I still believe my life is right here with you So just hold on And it won't take long I hope that you can love me When the pain is gone I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart I know it's taking a while but every lesson I've learned And if your heart speaks tonight I'll hear every word If you want to be free I'll never stand in your way But with all that I am I'm asking you to stay Hold on And it won't take long I hope that you can love me When the pain is gone I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart Don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart There's a light that can burn It exists in the heart You can feel it when you know love is true If you could try to be strong And keep the light burning long It took a lifetime but I found it in you Hold on And it won't take long I hope that you can love me When the pain is gone I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart Don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart of your broken heart
