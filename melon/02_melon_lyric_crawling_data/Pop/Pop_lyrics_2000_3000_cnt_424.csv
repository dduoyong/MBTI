No se como lo haremos Decidelo Sabes bien lo que pienso del amor  Yo quisiera confiar Poderme ilusionar Poder amar y ser amado Yo no puedo ser feliz, Pues no se distinguir Entre el amor y los halagos Yo prefiero no sonar vivir mirando al mar como un ermitano Incluso tu, La imagen del amor, Que carta jugaras Entre el amor y los halagos"

I'm still missing your love and the feelings we've shared. Sometimes I cry at night, cause I feel so all alone. I need your love right here with me. To keep me safe and warm.

  Barbra Streisand  ,Memory,"Midnight Not a sound from the pavement 한 밤중 거리에서는 아무 소리도 들리지 않네 Has the moon lost her memory? 달님도 추억을 잃어버린 걸까? She is smiling alone 홀로 미소짓고 있네 In the lamp light the withered leaves collect at my feet 가로등의 불빛아래 시든 낙엽들이 내 발밑에 쌓이고 있어 And the wind begins to moan 게다가 바람은 '윙윙' 구슬픈 소리를 내기 시작하네  Memory, all alone in the moon light 추억을 회상하며, 달빛 아래 나 홀로 I can dream of the old days 과거의 아름답던 시절을 다시 꿈꿀 수 있지 life was beautiful then 그 때에는 삶이 무척 아름다웠는데... I remember the time I knew what happiness was 내 기억으론, 그 때에는 내가 행복이 무엇인지를 알고 있었던 것 같아. Let the memory live again 과거의 즐거웠던 그 추억, 다시 내게 돌아오라...  Every street lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning 모든 가로등들이 곧 아침이 밝아올 것을 예시라도 하는 듯 깜빡거리며 운명적인 사인을 내보내고 있어 Someone mutters and a street lamp sputters 어떤이가 투덜거리고, 가로등이 서서히 꺼져가는 것을 보니 And soon it will be morning 곧 아침이 밝아올것 같아  Daylight I must wait for the sunrise 새벽에 해가 뜰 때까지 기다려야만해 I must think of a new life 새로운 삶을 설계해야만 하니까 And I mustn't give in 그리고 절대 포기해서는 안된다구 When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too 여명이 밝아오면 오늘밤도 역시 또 하나의 추억이 될거야 And a new day will begin 그리곤 새로운 날이 펼쳐질거야  Burnt-out ends of smoky days 연기 자욱하게 낀 암울한 날이 완전히 타들어 갈 무렵 The stale cold smell of morning 케케하고 냉랭한 아침 냄새가 느껴지고 A street lamp dies 가로등은 차츰 꺼져가네 Another night is over 또 하룻밤이 지나가고 Another day is dawning 새로운 날이 밝아오고 있어  Touch me It's so easy to leave me 절 잡아줘요 사람들은 저를 쉽게 외면하곤 한답니다 All alone with the memory of my days in the sun 과거 즐거웠던 시절을 회상하며 홀로 외로이 추억에 잠기게 하죠 If you touch me 만약 당신이 제 감정을 만질 수 있다면 You'll understand shat happiness is 행복이라는 것이 무엇인지 이해할 수 있을 거예요 Look, a new day has begun 자 보세요, 어느덧 새 날이 밝았군요"

"  Peter, Paul & Mary  ",Puff (The Magic Dragon),"Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee. Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff  Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee. Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.  together they would travel on a boat with billowed sails. Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail Noble kings and princess would bow when there they came. Pirate ships would lower their flads when Puff roared out his name.  Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee. Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.  A dragon lives forever but not so little boys Painted wings and giants rings make way for other toys. One gray night it happened Jackie Paper came no more And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.  His head was bent in sorrow. Grief scales fell like rain Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane. Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave. So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave.  Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee. Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee."

  Elvis Presley  ,Anything That`s Part Of You,"I memorize the note you sent 당신이 보낸 글들을 전부 기억해요 Go all the places that we went 우리가 함께 갔던곳을 돌아다녔지요. I seem to search the whole day through For anything that's part of you 난 당신의 흔적만 찾아서 하루종일 돌아 다니는것 같아요  I kept a ribbon from your hair 당신의 머리 리본을 간직 하고 있어요. A breath of perfume lingers there 아직 은은한 향수내음이 남아 있지요. It helps to cheer me when I'm blue Anything that's part of you 당신의 흔적은 내가 우울할 때 날 위로해 준답니다. 그게 사소한것 일지라도  Oh, how it hurts to miss you so When I know you don't love me.. anymore 당신이 더 이상 날 사랑하지 않음을 알면서도 당신을 그리워하는 건 너무 가슴아파요 To go on needing you 당신은 날 원하지 않음을 Knowing you don't need me 알면서도 당신을 계속 원하게 되네요.  No reason left for me to live 내겐 더이상 살아갈 이유가 없어요 What can I take, what can I give 무엇을 갖고,무엇을 주어야할까요.. When I'd give all of someone new 내가 새로운 사람에게 모든걸 준다해도 For anything that's part of you 당신의 흔적들 뿐일텐데.."

  Leona Lewis  ,Heartbeat,If I could have laid low I would be creeping round the streets Avoiding all the busy main roads And keep anounce of dignity And if I could have stayed home I would have slept through everything Turn off my phone and breathe a silence Stay in the comfort zone of me Cause nobody lies in their bed Nobody's heart gets broken Nobody cries in there but I ain't going in When I don't speak Weak and hollow heartbeats Leaking through my heart seam Body sells me out sells me out So I keep this deep and shallow heartbeat Under my control And you will never see me weak And you will never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Oooohhh beat If I never met you I would be busy with my life Going to work and still be happy I will be sleeping through the nights And if I could forget you I would go back and look for parts For patching up my broken heart And I would shut my aching eyes Cause nobody shouts at their friends Nobody wants forgiveness Nobody doubts in there but I ain't giving in When I don't speak Weak and hollow heartbeats Leaking from my heart seam Body sells me out sells me out So I keep this deep and shallow heartbeat Under my control And you will never see me weak And you will never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat beat beat If I keep it down Just focus I'm invisible Cause when there is no sound I know where I belong I will be ok When I don't speak Weak and hollow heartbeats Leaking from my heart seam Body sells me out sells me out no no no So I keep this deep and shallow heatbeat Under my control And you will never see me weak You will never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat beat beat Heartbeat my heartbeat

  Various Artists  ,Khe Sanh,"I left my heart to the sappers round Khe Sanh And my soul was sold with my cigarettes to the blackmarket man I've had the Vietnam cold turkey From the ocean to the Silver City And it's only other vets could understand About the long forgotten dockside guarantees How there were no V dayheroes in 1973 How we sailed into Sydney Harbour Saw an old friend but couldn't kiss her She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land And she was like so many more from that time on Their lives were all so empty, till they found their chosen one And their legs were often open But their minds were always closed And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, paypacket lean And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been But the car parks made me jumpy And I never stopped the dreams Or the growing need for speed and novacaine So I worked across the country end to end Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend Held a job on an oil rig Flying choppers when I could But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend And I've travelled round the world from year to year And each one found me aimless, one more year the worse for wear And I've been back to South East Asia But the answer sure ain't there But I'm drifting north, to check things out again You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone Only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong There ain't nothing like the kisses From a jaded Chinese princess I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone Yeah the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone And it's really got me worried I'm goin' nowhere and I'm in a hurry And the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone"

  Sting  ,August Winds,When August winds are turning The fishing boats set out upon the sea I watch 'til they sail out of sight The winter follows soon I watch them drawn into the night Beneath the August moon No one knows I come here Some things I don't share I can't explain the reasons why It moves me close to tears Or something in the season's change Will find me wandering here And in my public moments I hear the things I say but they're not me Perhaps I'll know before I die Admit that there's a reason why I count the boats returning to the sea I count the boats returning to the sea And in my private moments I drop the mask that I've been forced to wear But no one knows this secret me Where albeit unconsciously I count the boats returning from the sea I count the boats returning from the sea

Sometimes I see your face The stars seem to lose their place Why must I think of you? Why must I? Why should I?  Why should I cry for you? Why would you want me to? And what would it mean to say ""I loved you in my fashion""? What would be true? Why should I? Why should I cry for you?"

  George Michael  ,Praying For Time (Remastered 2006),These are the days of the open hand They will not be the last Look around now These are the days of the beggars and the choosers This is the year of the hungry man Whose place is in the past Hand in hand with ignorance And legitimate excuses The rich declare themselves poor And most of us are not sure If we have too much But we'll take our chances Because god's stopped keeping score I guess somewhere along the way He must have let us all out to play Turned his back and all god's children Crept out the back door And it's hard to love there's so much to hate Hanging on to hope When there is no hope to speak of And the wounded skies above say it's much much too late Well maybe we should all be praying for time These are the days of the empty hand Oh you hold on to what you can And charity is a coat you wear twice a year This is the year of the guilty man Your television takes a stand And you find that what was over there is over here So you scream from behind your door Say what's mine is mine and not yours I may have too much but I'll take my chances Because god's stopped keeping score And you cling to the things they sold you Did you cover your eyes when they told you That he can't come back Beacuse he has no children to come back for And it's hard to love there's so much to hate Hanging on to hope When there is no hope to speak of And the wounded skies above say it's much too late Well maybe we should all be praying for time
