  Ant Saunders  ,Yellow Hearts,She put my name with yellow hearts Her favorite color like the stars I didn't listen very hard When she told me she was crazy from the start She put my name with yellow hearts Yeah she did I said she was a work of art Work of art I didn't listen very hard Very hard no no When she told me she was crazy from the start I drive down open roads so slow Here comes a train I'll let it go Ain't got nobody on my phone Don't like being all alone Don't like being all alone Not good at keeping with the trends No no Too good at welcoming amends It's been a while since I've heard her say That we were more than friends Oh Oh I I-I-I know a lot is going on But girl please tell me And I'll let you be Are you still with me or not She put my name with yellow hearts Her favorite color like the stars I didn't listen very hard When she told me she was crazy from the start She put my name with yellow hearts Yeah she did I said she was a work of art Work of art I didn't listen very hard Very hard no no When she told me she was crazy from the start She put yellow hearts around my name I thought they were all just the same To you what do they really mean Have you only been playing games I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature Primroses blooming in the night Birds wanna take me on a flight Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier Chasers are of no good use This taste will be long endured Why'd you have to go so soon I thought this was as good as new She put yellow hearts around my name I thought they were all just the same To you what do they really mean Have you only been playing games She put my name with yellow hearts Yeah she did Her favorite color like the stars Like the stars I didn't listen very hard Very hard no no When she told me she was crazy from the start She put my name with yellow hearts She put yellow hearts around my name I said she was a work of art I thought they were all just the same I didn't listen very hard To you what do they really mean When she told me she was crazy from the start Have you only been playing games Have you only been playing games No no

  Kristen Anderson-Lopez  ,For The First Time In Forever (Demo),The window is open so's that door I didn't know they did that anymore Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates For years I've roamed these empty halls Why have a ballroom with no balls Finally they're opening up the gates There'll be happy smiling people It'll be totally strange But wow am I so ready for this change for the first time in forever There'll be music there'll be light For the first time in forever I'll be dancing through the night Don't know if I'm elated or gassy But I'm somewhere in that zone Cause for the first time in forever I won't be alone Tonight imagine me gown and all Fetchingly draped against the wall The picture of sophisticated grace I suddenly see him standing there A beautiful stranger tall and fair I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face But then we laugh and talk all evening Which is totally bizarre Nothing like the life I've lead so far For the first time in forever There'll be magic there'll be fun For the first time in forever I could be noticed by someone And I know it is totally crazy To dream I'd find romance But for the first time in forever At least I've got a chance Don't let them in don't let them see Be the good girl you always have to be Conceal don't feel put on a show Make one wrong move and everyone will know But it's only for today It's only for today It's agony to wait It's agony to wait Tell the guards to open up the gate The gate For the first time in forever Don't let them in don't let them see I'm getting what I'm dreaming of Be the good girl you always have to be A chance to change my lonely world Conceal A chance to find true love Conceal don't feel don't let them know I know it all ends tomorrow So it has to be today 'Cause for the first time in forever For the first time in forever Nothing's in my way

  Spice Girls  ,Christmas Wrapping,"Bah! Humbug - no, that's too strong Cos it's my favorite holiday But all this year's been a busy blur Don't think I have the energy To add to my already mad rush Just because it is the season The perfect gift for me would be Completions and connections left from Last year, world tour Aeroplanes and babies Met some guys but never the time Most of '98 passed along those lines So deck the halls and trim those trees Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer I just need to catch my breath Christmas with my mates this year  Calendar picture, frozen landscape Chilled this room for twenty-four days Evergreens, sparkling snow Get this winter over with! Flashback to springtime, saw him again Would've been good to go for lunch Couldn't agree we were both free We tried, we said we'd keep in touch We didn't, of course, 'till the summertime Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?

Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year  Tesco has provided me With the world's smallest turkey Already in the oven, nice and hot Oh damn, guess what I forgot? So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow To the only all-night garage But when to my wondering eyes should appear In the line that guy I've been chasing all year ""Spending this one alone,"" he said ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."" I said, ""Me too, but why are you? You mean you forgot the papers too?"" Then suddenly we laughed and laughed Caught on to what was happening Christmas magic's brought this tale To a very happy e-ending  Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

I seem to search the whole day through For anything that's part of you 난 당신의 흔적만 찾아서 하루종일 돌아 다니는것 같아요  I kept a ribbon from your hair 당신의 머리 리본을 간직 하고 있어요. A breath of perfume lingers there 아직 은은한 향수내음이 남아 있지요. It helps to cheer me when I'm blue Anything that's part of you 당신의 흔적은 내가 우울할 때 날 위로해 준답니다. 그게 사소한것 일지라도  Oh, how it hurts to miss you so When I know you don't love me.. anymore 당신이 더 이상 날 사랑하지 않음을 알면서도 당신을 그리워하는 건 너무 가슴아파요 To go on needing you 당신은 날 원하지 않음을 Knowing you don't need me 알면서도 당신을 계속 원하게 되네요.  No reason left for me to live 내겐 더이상 살아갈 이유가 없어요 What can I take, what can I give 무엇을 갖고,무엇을 주어야할까요.. When I'd give all of someone new 내가 새로운 사람에게 모든걸 준다해도 For anything that's part of you 당신의 흔적들 뿐일텐데.."

  Harry Nilsson  ,Over The Rainbow,"Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, 저기 어딘가에, 무지개 너머에, 저 높은 곳에  There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby. 자장가에 가끔 나오는 나라가 있다고 들었어  Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, 저기 어딘가에, 무지개 너머에, 푸른 하늘에  And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. 니가 감히 꿈꿔왔던 일들이 정말 현실이 되는 나라.  One(some) day I'll wish upon a star 어느날 나는 별에게 소원을 빌었어  And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. 그리고 구름 저 건너에 일어났지  Where troubles melt like lemon drops 걱정은 마치 레몬즙처럼 녹아버리고  Away above the chimney tops 굴뚝 저 높이에  That's where you'll find me. 그곳이 바로 네가 나를 찾을 곳이야.  Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly, 무지개 저 너머 어딘가에, 파랑새는 날아다니고,  Birds fly over the rainbow, 새들은 무지개 너머로 날아가는데  Why, oh why can't I? 왜.. 왜 나는 날아갈 수 없을까?  if happy little blue birds fly 행복한 작은 파랑새는  beyond the rainbow 무지개 너머로 날아갈 수 있는데  why, oh why can't I? 왜, 왜 나는 날아갈 수 없을까?"
