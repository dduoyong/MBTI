  Natalie Imbruglia  ,Starting Today,Starting today I'm not going to waste another moment Even if I Had the chance before I would have blown it But you took me by surprise And you caught me just in time Everyday You give me reason not to walk away I stop believing that the world's gone crazy And if it is you'll save me starting today I'm not going to worry about tomorrow I'll wash away all this fear that's left me feeling hollow cause you make me want to try And you caught me just in time Everyday You give me reason not to walk away I'll stop believing I should burn like crazy Cos if I did you chase me Anyway I should have told you So many times That I shyed away Somehow you always seem to Be there making it easy And you give me reason to stay Everyday Everyday Everyday Oh everyday I'll stop believing that I should burn like crazy Cos if I did you chase me Anyway You give me reason not to walk away I stop believing that the world's gone crazy And if it is you'll save me Starting today I'm not going to waste another moment

Are you happier now? Are your demons out? Do you really think? Do you think?  [Chorus] But we're gonna burn 'Cause we know we smoke and we never learn Yeah, we lose all control for the joy ride Living in the high, never alone And then we do it again My lungs kinda burn 'Cause we know we smoke and we never learn Do we let go of hope for the joy ride? Living in the high, I'm in over my head, mmm  [Outro] For the joy ride For the joy ride For the joy ride"

  Christina Perri  ,Sea Of Lovers,"A certain type of wind has swept me up But till it’s found each bone I, I’m overcome There is an icy breath out escapes my lips And I am lost again A certain type of darkness is stalling me Under a quite mask of uncertainty I wait for light like water from the sky And I am lost again In the sea of lovers without ships A lovers without sign You’re the only way out of it A sea of lovers losing time A lovers losing hope Will you let me follow you Wherever you go Bring me home A certain type of silence is filled my voice A scream beneath the water make no noise All my prayers gone quiet and never heard And I am lost again In the sea of lovers without ships A lovers without sign You’re the only way out of it A sea of lovers losing time A lovers losing hope Will you let me follow you Wherever you go Bring me home A certain type of wind has swept me up But till it’s found each bone I, I’m overcome There is an icy breath out escapes my lips And I am lost again In the sea of lovers without ships A lovers without sign You’re the only way out of it A sea of lovers losing time A lovers losing hope You’re the only way out of it A the sea of lovers without ships A lovers without sign You’re the only way out of it A sea of lovers losing time A lovers losing hope Will you let me follow you Wherever you go Bring me home"
  Fiona Apple  ,Paper Bag,I was staring at the sky Just looking for a star To pray on or wish on or something like that I was having a sweet fix Of a daydream of a boy Whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had But then the dove of hope began its downward slope And I believed for a moment That my chances were approaching to be grabbed But as it came down near So did a weary tear I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love And I went crazy again today Looking for a strand to climb Looking for a little hope Baby said he couldn't stay Wouldn't put his lips to mine And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope I said honey I don't feel so good Don't feel justified Come on put a little love here in my void He said it's all in your head I said so's everything but he didn't get it I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love

  The Swell Season  ,Falling Slowly,"I don't know you But I want you All the more for that Words fall through me And always fool me And I can't react And games that never amount To more than they're meant Will play themselves out Take this sinking boat and point it home We've still got time Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice You've made it now Falling slowly, eyes that know me And I can't go back And moods that take me and erase me And I'm painted black Well you have suffered enough And warred with yourself It's time that you won Take this sinking boat and point it home We've still got time Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice You've made it now Falling slowly sing your melody I'll sing along"

  Linda Perry  ,Life In A Bottle,"Life in a bottle It feels so comforting Seems like that's my destiny Fake what you want Selective memory Wrap me up, and set me free  Meet my friend Held tightly in my hand Forgetting what I meant to say  Love but to hate That's just the way it goes Inch by Inch I sink below  And I love, I love, I love All my bad company And I know, I know, I know that's what's meant to be So there's nothing let for me to say.  Stoned and demented Walking through the walls When I banged my head I slowly fell  Sad but delighted Swimming in my well I guess I'm going straight to Hell  And I love, I love, I love All my bad company And I know, I know, I know That's what's meant to be And I love, I love, I love All my bad company  So there's nothing let for me to say No there's nothing let for me to say  And I love, I love, I love All my bad company And I know, I know, I know That's what's meant to be And I love, I love, I love All my bad company  So there's nothing let for me to say No there's nothing let for me to say"
