  ABBA  ,"My Love, My Life","I've seen it on your face Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase So now we'll go separate ways Never again we two Never again, nothing I can do Like an image passing by, my love, my life In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly) Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely) Was it a dream, a lie? Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life Are the words you try to find, my love, my life But I know I don't possess you So go away, God bless you You are still my love and my life Still my one and only I've watched you look away Tell me is it really so hard to say? Oh, this has been my longest day Sitting here close to you Knowing that maybe tonight we're through Like an image passing by, my love, my life In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly) Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely) Was it a dream, a lie? Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life Are the words you try to find, my love, my life But I know I don't possess you So go away, God bless you You are still my love and my life Yes I know I don't possess you So go away, God bless you You are still my love and my life Still my one and only"

  Mariah Carey  ,Petals,I've often wondered if there's Ever been a perfect family I've always longed for undividedness And sought stability A flower taught me how to pray But as I grew that flower changed She started failing in the wind Like golden petals scattering And I miss you dandelion And even love you And I wish there was a way For me to trust you But it hurts me every time I try to touch you But I miss you dandelion And even love you I gravitated towards a patriarch So young predictably I was resigned to spend my life With a maze of misery A boy and girl befriended me We're bonded through despondency I stayed so long but finally I fled to save my sanity And I miss you little sis and Little brother And I hope you realize I'll always love you And although you're struggling You will recover And I miss you little sis and Little brother So many I considered Closest to me Turned on a dime and sold me Out dutifully Although that knife was chipping Away at me They turned their eyes away and Went home to sleep And I missed a lot of life But I'll recover Though I know you really like To see me suffer Still I wish that you and I'd Forgive each other 'Cause I miss you Valentine And really loved you I guess I loved you I tried so hard But To preserve my sanity And I found the strength to break away Fly
