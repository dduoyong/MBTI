  Paula Cole  ,I Don`t Want to Wait,So open up your morning light And say a little prayer for I you know that if we are to stay alive Then see the peace in every eye  She had two babies One was six months one was three In the war of 44 Every telephone ring every heartbeat stinging When she thought it was God calling her Oh would her son grow to know his father I don't want to wait for our lives to be over I want to know right now what will it be I don't want to wait for our lives to be over Will it be yes or will it be sorry  He showed up all wet on the rainy front step Wearing shrapnel in his skin And the war he saw lives inside him still It's so hard to be gentle and warm The years pass by and now he has granddaughters I don't want to wait for our lives to be over I want to know right now what will it be I don't want to wait for our lives to be over Will it be yes or will it be You look at me from across the room You're wearing your anguish again Believe me I know the feeling It sucks you into the jaws of anger So breathe a little more deeply my love All we have is this very moment And I don't want to do what his father and his father and his father did I want to be here now So open up your morning light And say a little prayer for I You know that if we are to stay alive Then see the peace in every eye I don't want to wait for our lives to be over I want to know right now what will it be I don't want to wait for our lives to be over Will it be yes or will it be I don't want to wait for our lives to be over I want to know right now what will it be I don't want to wait for our lives to be over Will it be yes or will it be sorry  So open up your morning light And say a little prayer for I You know that if we are to stay alive Then see the love in every eye

  Ariana Grande  ,Best Mistake (Feat.

  Umbrellas  ,The City Lights,"If you see me at midnight Walking the streets You'll know it was me For I cannot sleep  I've pushed away the dreams And spoiled the quiet I'm propelled by fear And not the righteous  So have you been to a place like this? To see your breath as it paints against the sky The fever is near I wish you were here  I'm thinking ambitious I've got this feeling Things will be alright So go break a leg, night  Been given the green light So go entertain them They're waiting for you They're waiting for you  So have you been to a place like this? To see your breath as it paints against the sky Feeling so right and things will run The fever is near I wish you were here"

  Art Garfunkel  ,Why Worry,"Baby, I see this world has made you sad, Some people can be bad The things they do, the things they say. But, baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears. I'll chase away those restless fears That turn your blue skies into gray. Why Worry? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? Why Worry, now? Baby, when I get down I turn to you, And you make sense of what I do And, no, it isn't hard to say. But, baby, just when this world Seems mean and cold Our love comes shining red and gold And all the rest is by the way. Why Worry? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? Why Worry, now? Why Worry? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? Why Worry, now? (Why Worry? Why Worry, now?) (Repeat and Fade)"

Dust gathers on my stereo  Cos I can`t bare to hear the radio  The piano sits in a shaded space  With a picture of your face.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone and I`m scared.    Coffee stains on your favorite book  Remind me of you so I can`t even look.  The magazines you left on the floor,      You won`t need them anymore.    A towel left hangin on the wall,  No sign of wet foosteps in the hall  There`s no smell of your sweet cologne.  I`m lying here alone.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone and now I`m scared.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone, now I`m scared.  In an instant you were gone and I`m scared"

You didn't do this alone. And it's time you should know.  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns.  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns.  You said the words but I wrote the poem. Enjoyed the warmth but I built the home. But the grave that you dug wasn't deep enough for me.  Now you wanna cast me aside. Well hey it's an eye for an eye. And I won't be crucified.  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns.  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall.

Parting the waters of the world befor it gets too late.  Well do you hear my gospel that you can't have? This time you'll write it yourself. Cause mine's not yours to take. This time This time This time  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns.  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns -

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety, But you could end up as the only one. Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society. At night a candle's brighter than the sun.  Takes more than combat gear to make a man. Takes more than a license for a gun. Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can. A gentleman will walk but never run.  If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said, He's the hero of the day. It takes a man to suffer ignorance and mile. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say."
