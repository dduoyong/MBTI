  Patti Labelle And Her Blue Belles  ,Danny Boy,"""Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountain side. The summer's gone, and all the roses falling, It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.  But come ye back when summer's in the meadow, Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow, It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow, Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!  But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying, If I am dead, as dead I well may be, You'll come and find the place where I am lying, And kneel and say an Ave there for me. And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me, And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be, For you will bend and tell me that you love me, And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!  """

  Melanie C.  ,If That Were Me,"Where do they go and what do they do? They're walking on by. They're looking at you. Some people stop, some people stare. But would they help you and do they care?   How did you fall? Did you fall at all? Are you happy when you are sleeping underneath the stars? When it's cold is it your hope that keeps you warm?   A spare bit of change is all that I give. How is that gonna help when you've got nowhere to live? Some turn away so they don't see. I bet you'd look if that were me.   How did you fall? Did you fall at all? Is it lonely where you are sleeping in between parked cars? When it thunders where do you hide from the storm?   Could you ever forgive my self-pity? When you've got nothing and you're living on the streets of the city. I couldn't live without my phone. But you don't even have a home.   How did we fall? Can we get up at all? Are we happy where we are on our lonely little star? When it's cold is it your hope that keeps you warm?   Where do they go and what do they do? They're walking on by. They're looking at you. They're walking on by. They're looking at you.    (Melanie ChisholmRick Nowels)"
