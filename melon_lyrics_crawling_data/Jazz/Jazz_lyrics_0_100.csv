"  Bye, Lupita  ",Para Los Enamorados,"그대 내게 보낸 amor 조심스레 떨리는 손으로 나를 이끌던 나의 사랑아 조금은 달콤하게 다가와 나에게 말해주길  차마 얘기 못한 amor 눈을 감으면 내 마음도 네게 있음을 알텐데 나의 사랑아 조금은 솔직하게 수줍은 내 귓가에 들려줘 그대의 고백  그대가 이끄는 리듬으로 꿈처럼 아득한 그볼레로 불어오는 바람에 나를 맡기고 내 마음이 말하는 대로 내 입술이 바라는 대로 Oh, mi amor 그대에게 보내는 kiss"

  Ella Fitzgerald  ,Over The Rainbow,"When all the world is a hopless jumble and the raindrops tumble all around heaven opens a magic lane  When all the clouds darken up the skyway There's a rainbow highway to be found Leading from your window pane  To a place behind the sun Just a step beyond the rain  Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullabye  Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true  Someday day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me  Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why, then oh why can't I  Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me  Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why, then oh why can't I  If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh why can't I"
  Stacey Kent  ,Let Yourself Go,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble? As you listen to them play don't you get a glow? If you step out on the floor You'll forget your trouble If you go into your dance You'll forget your woe So:Come Get together Let the dance floor feel your leather Step as lightly as a feather Let yourself goCome Hit the timber Loosen up and start to limber Can't you hear that hot marimba? Let yourself goLet yourself go Relax And let yourself go Relax You've got yourself tied up in a knot The night is cold but the music's hot SoCome Cuddle closer Don't you dare to answer No, sir Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer Let yourself go"
  Vince Guaraldi Trio  ,O Tannenbaum,O Christmas Tree O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How are thy leaves so verdant O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How are thy leaves so verdant Not only in the summertime But even in winter is thy prime O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How are thy leaves so verdant O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Much pleasure doth thou bring me O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Much pleasure doth thou bring me For every year the Christmas tree Brings to us all both joy and glee O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Much pleasure doth thou bring me O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Thy candles shine out brightly O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Thy candles shine out brightly Each bough doth hold its tiny light That makes each toy to sparkle bright O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Thy candles shine out brightly
"  Frank Sinatra ,  Antonio Carlos Jobim  ",How Insensitive (Insensatez),How insensitive I must have seemed When she told me that she loved me How unmoved and cold I must have seemed When she told me so sincerely Why she must have asked Did I just turn and stare in icy silence What was I to say What can you say when a love affair is over Now she's gone away And I'm alone with the memory of her last look Vague and drawn and sad I see it still All her heartbreak in that last look Why she must have asked Did I just stare in icy silence What was I to do What can one do when a love affair is over
  Amy Winehouse  ,(There Is) No Greater Love,"There is no greater love Than what I feel for you No sweeter song, no heart so true There is no greater thrill Than what you bring to me No sweeter song Than what you sing, sing to me You're the sweetest thing I have ever known And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love In all the world, it's true No greater love Than what I feel for you"
