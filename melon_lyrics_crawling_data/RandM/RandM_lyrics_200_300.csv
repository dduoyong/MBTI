  Pink Floyd  ,High Hopes (Radio Edit),"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder  [Verse 2] Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  [Instrumental]  [Verse 3] Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been so many times  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river For ever and ever  [Instrumental]  [Outro] ""Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie! Great..."""
  Run River North  ,Fight To Keep,I left my heart on the top of a window sill Fell apart when the winds pulled it down On the ground where sun drove the colors deep In the summer heat the colors seem to drown X2 But you pulled up the colors with a simple tune You breath a song and you dusted off the sand You put the pieces on your sleeve Oh you gave my heart to me You look so pretty that I fell upon my knees X2 The ground I saw your face You spoke of love oh you sang of grace But come the night when the light is gone It's in the dark that my deeds are done What I've done in darkness I must turn away This mangled heart is meant for so much more Though the wind it's telling me that it's ok I'll stand my ground till I hear the kingdom come X2 So I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night For I found words to keep me still Oh I'm prone to go and make the same mistakes I hear your voice calling out my name From the ground I saw your face You spoke of love oh you sang of grace But come the night when the light is gone It's in the dark that my deeds are done X2 I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night X15 Fight to keep the fire burning X6

She'll endure all she can But you could make this easier on her It's all like sinking You're trying to stay afloat Like a wind blown paper boat Over uncharted sea There's no question why You're driving to kill some time Racing the power lines Back into town Go to her foolish man What's the use of having pride if you don't have her? She'll endure all she can But you could make this easier on her Go to her foolish man What's the use of having pride if you don't have her? She'll endure all she can But you could make this easier on her Make this easier on her Make this easier on her Make this easier on her

  This Day And Age  ,Always Straight Ahead,"She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight. She's like a sinking stone, fading from the surface, but we are never alone. She's on a tightrope, losing balance, yet something's pulling her towards hope. I want to run to her, but I've already played that card, so I will fight the urge. Eyes closed, fingers crossed; praying that she's lost... You'll never know what's around the bend. ""Avoid the unknown"" is ringing in your head... She has a fear of love, accepting everything but what she really dreamed of. She keeps her heart locked; no she won't ever answer even though she hears a knock. But love is at the door, and after all isn't that what we are here for? I want to rescue her, but I've already tried, for there is only one cure. (She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight)... While you rest inside your regret, the sun rises and   sets again... You're in your way, that's why you'll always be the same."
