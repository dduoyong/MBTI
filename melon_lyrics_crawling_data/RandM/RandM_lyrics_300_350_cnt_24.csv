  Sondre Lerche  ,"John, Let Me Go","Do you have enough to fill a page? Is there something I should read, Amplifiers broke the news today, I was whispering the details  When the world came in I've seen it before wearing shimmering clothes Is the world worth it's spending? Is that world worth one defending it?  How should I know? When the phone attacks with numbers I dont trust  (Chorus) John, Let me go! I can't conjugate myself If investigation fails I'm on my own (my head will roll)  When the coward sits alone again When you've spent your feathers up(up) Making sense is made impossible Making you detect my aim - uh?  When I'm answering I've seen this before You are changing things In a would full of sorrow Only fools with narrow minds can join  How could I know? The calls I make've number I dont trust  (Chorus)"
