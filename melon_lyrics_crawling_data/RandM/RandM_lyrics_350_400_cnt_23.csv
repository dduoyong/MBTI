  Dio  ,Strange Highways,It's a crazy world we live in and I'm leaving it today for another institution we crazy people play Every time I climb the mountain and it turned into a hill I promised me that I'd move on and I will I I good for nothing going nowhere so they say hey someone give me blessings for they say that I have sinned That when I crawl inside myself and ride into the wind on strange highways on strange highways Hey you I want your number don't even wonder we do things our way here Questions these are forbidden we got no answers believe us anyway So here is my confession it's the only broken rule sometimes I crawl inside of me Where I can be the fool on strange highways on strange highways oh You can see the other side and you shall come over you can't leave the other side if you say I will Everytime I climb the mountain and it turned into a hill well I promised me I'd disappear and now I know I will So someone give me blessings for the times you say I've sinned So I can crawl inside myself and ride into the wind on strange highways on strange highways Questions they're forbidden hey you what's your number oh we've got no answers Don't you even wonder on strange highways aaah
  Dream Theater  ,Another Day (2007 Remix),"Live another day  Climb a little higher  Find another reason to stay  Ashes in your hands  Mercy in your eyes  If you`re searching for a silent sky...  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So die another day  The coldness of this words  The message in his silence,  ""Face the candle to the wind...""  This distance in my voice  Isn`t leaving you a choice  So if you`re looking for a time to run away...  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day  They took picture of our dreams  Ran to hide behind the stairs  And said maybe when it`s right  for you, they`ll fall  But if they don`t come down  Resist to need to pull them in  And throw them away  Better to save the mystery  Than surrender to the secret  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day"
  DevilDriver  ,Not All Who Wander Are Lost (Explicit),"Only the gods know They're looking right through you Straight into the eyes of a dead man There isn't enough hours in the day What will be seen When your world comes crashing down Staring in the eyes of a gone man No more fuckin' time left on your side, on you side All of your hopes and dreams don't mean shit All that's left is, now to nowhere I believe do anything at all costs You must believe Not all who wander are lost Tied to the tree of woe, so woe to you In front of the man with the dead eyes With a choir of faith there's still hell to pay Not enough hours in the day Hell of patience to be paid So who's left to wonder In the wake of destruction, get made All of your hopes and dreams never meant shit All that's left is, now to nowhere I believe, do anything at all costs You must believe Not all who wander are lost Something, somewhere, injects the eye Texas Nights Defines the sky"
  Pantera  ,Suicide Note Pt.Ⅱ,"Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away  Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine    [Pre]  When I'm hiding, when I need it,  it lets me breathe,  for our handle on this life, I don't believe  this time    [Chorus]  Would you look at me now?  Can you tell I'm a man?  With these scars on my wrists  To prove I'll try again  Try to die again, try to live through this night  Try to die again.....
