  Noel Gallagher`s High Flying Birds  ,AKA...Broken Arrow (Album Version),Fallen Angel the Broken Arrow she comfort me and ease my trouble mind Shine a light out into the shadows all the world they made me leave behind Leave me in peace I'm on the side of the angels If I die in a dream then let me live my life But all the lies that they have told me they make me want to shiver when I'm lost and I'm lonely that's not going to ease my troubled mind She's rolling over a misty morning set the sail for where the four winds blow She a siren and I'm a warning Hear to say I never told you so Leave me in peace I'm on the side of the angels If I die in a dream then let me live my life But all the lies that they have told me they make me want to shiver when I'm lost and I'm lonely that's not going to ease my troubled mind Leave me in peace I'm all alone in my angel she died in a dream so I could live my life But all the lies that they have told me they make me want to shiver when I'm lost and I'm lonely that's not going to ease my troubled mind that's not going to ease my troubled mind Fallen Angel the Broken Arrow she comfort me and ease my trouble mind Shine a light out into the shadows all the world they made me leave behind

  Red House Painters  ,Golden,Sister woke me up As he fell out of the sky There's a golden place Where the angels crash and die You can jab and poke Oh but what'd you ever give I don't hear your voice Hear it resonate like his Hear it resonate like his  You were endless fuel Burning fast and burning free Not a wide eyed fool That fell into the sea That vanished in the sea     You're alive and good StJohn As the AM waves live on You as much belong to me As a ship steered to the sea As a ship steered to the sea  You're the cornerstone Of my memories as a kid Filled my room with sun When that polished vinyl spun I will see your face Crashing down against the wind And it's a sadder place When that crackling vinyl spins When the crackling vinyl spins  You're still living good StJohn High up in the yellow sun We can find your vacant grin In every dusty thrift store bin You're a dime a dozen man You're a dime a dozen man  And you're far beyond the moon That you dreamed to touch so soon And your life was big and full Like your words so beautiful Dum de dum de dum dum dum Always echo across the world
