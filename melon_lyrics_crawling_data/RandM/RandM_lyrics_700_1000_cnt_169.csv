  Marketa Irglova  ,We Are Good,Early morning rising with the sun Resting where the sky meets the earth Feeling the first rays of sunlight reaching into my soul Where they reinstate the sense of my own self worth If you're not good you're bad That's far too black and white Behold the glorious sun in all its radiance bright It too at times is obscured by the thick blue veil of night Still the moon and all the stars combine to reflect it's light And so it is that we are good Though we do not always do as we should We lose track of right and wrong And we're not always standing strong But still don't you wanna believe In things that eyes do not perceive Like our light shining from within That in a battle with our darkness can win The gates of heaven open up before me As my heart is given wings and flies Leaving all pretense behind everything is crystal clear Even the worry of uncertainty subsides They say that time will come for us to be reborn Into the newness of unity that has been torn Into duality into it's us against them It's from a place of fear that all our conflicts stem We're almost there but not yet still the stage is set For the play we may enact according to our contract That we may both you and I with everybody in our home up high To awaken from our deep and long undisturbed though hardly peaceful sleep If to look is to know the grace which you bestow Upon those that you would raise into a kind and loving gaze Then to look is to see everyone as good as they can be

  Eric Clapton  ,Old Love,"I can feel your body When I'm lying in bed There's too much confusion Going around through my head  And it makes me so angry To know that the flame still burns Why can't I get over? When will I ever learn?

  U2  ,Do You Feel Loved,Take these hands they're good for nothing You know these hands have never worked a day Take these boots they're going nowhere You know these boots they don't want to stray You got my head filled with songs You got my shoelaces undone Take my shirt go on take it off me You can tear it up If you can tie me down Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?  Take the colours of my imagination Take the scent hanging in the air Take this tangle of a coversation And turn it into your own prayer With my fingers as you want them With my nails under your hide With my teeth at your back And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?  Love's a bully pushing shoving In the belly of a woman Heavy rhythm taking over To stick together A man and a woman Stick together Man and woman Stick together ... Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved? And it looks like the sun But it feels like the rain And there's heat in the sun To see us through the rain Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?

  Rise Against  ,Behind Closed Doors,Chairs thrown and tables toppled Hands armed with broken bottles Standing no chance to win but We're not running we're not running  There's a point I think we're missing It's in the air we raise our fists in In the smiles we cast each other My sister my brother About the time we gave up hoping We'd ever find these locks still open Stumbling on stones unturned The hurt we feel we all have earned The lines we cross in search of change but all they see is treason Although we have no obligation to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive Break out I won't be left here Behind closed doors Bonfires burn like beacons Guiding the lost and weakened Flames dance on crashing waves Guiding ships who've gone astray Time out let's stop and think this through We've all got better things to do Than talk in circles run in place Answers inches from our face Although we have no obligation to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive Break out I won't be left here Behind closed doors  Black eyes broken fingers Blood drips and I let it run down my lips into my swollen gums When hope is non existent Our instincts all scream Run We never turn our backs or even bite our tongues Although we have no obligation to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive Break out I won't be left here Behind closed doors Although we have no obligation to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive Break out I won't be left here Behind closed doors
  Maximilian Hecker  ,The Beauty of My World,"Long ago I tried so hard to lose you and to be with you All at the same time Touching you and still staying afar   And lately you have tried so hard to soothe and to caress me Oh while all I dreamed of was to hide away, yet to be found   And someday I will trail my spirit’s voice And hold on to what it says And maybe I will be astounded by the beauty of my world   And nowadays I only seem to find my peace in piles of shards of failed attempts to love And failed attempts to take my life"

Careful of the stitches Insisted there was more than this.  But I lost myself, I cannot speak. To live by myself I am far too weak. I have lost myself and I cannot sleep, To live by myself I am far too weak.  Sold again on the one love, The one that all of them scream about. She's broke her wings on the one love, Her heart's so warm but its burn she wants.  I have always found it Easier to skirt around it Careful of the stitches, She insisted there was more than this.  And I lost myself I cannot speak To live by myself I'm far too weak. I have lost myself and I cannot sleep, To live by myself I am far too weak."
