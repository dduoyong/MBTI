  Danny & The Veetos  ,Alright,"Do you know how many sides I see Cause in the night my shadows tend to light Do you remember all those lovely vived scenes, they seemed to faith, when neckless call me back Yeah you please tell me, that everything is alright, alright  My colours seem to blossom, when the flowers reappear and the truth tends to overwhelm the giants in the sky, somehow I feel lost in this fast ocean of myself, but I guess it will be alright, yeah I guess everything will be alright, alright  But there is hope in the silence when I'm searching, when I know That I'm one in a billion of lovely faces I'm born in praises But there is hope in the silence when I'm searching, when I know That I'm one in a billion of lovely faces I'm born in praises"

"  Zac Efron ,  Zendaya  ",Rewrite The Stars,You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide I know you want me So don't keep saying our hands are tied You claim it's not in the cards But fate is pulling you miles away And out of reach from me But you're here in my heart So who can stop me if I decide That you're my destiny What if we rewrite the stars Say you were made to be mine Nothing could keep us apart You'd be the one I was meant to find It's up to you and it's up to me No one can say what we get to be So why don't we rewrite the stars Maybe the world could be ours Tonight You think it's easy You think I don't want to run to you But there are mountains And there are doors that we can't walk through I know you're wondering why Because we're able to be Just you and me Within these walls But when we go outside You're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all No one can rewrite the stars How can you say you'll be mine Everything keeps us apart And I'm not the one you were meant to find It's not up to you It's not up to me When everyone tells us what we can be How can we rewrite the stars Say that the world can be ours Tonight All I want is to fly with you All I want is to fall with you So just give me all of you It feels impossible It's not impossible Is it impossible Say that it's possible How do we rewrite the stars Say you were made to be mine Nothing can keep us apart Cause you are the one I was meant to find It's up to you and it's up to me No one can say what we get to be And why don't we rewrite the stars Changing the world to be ours You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide But I can't have you We're bound to break and My hands are tied

But he just looked at me confused (Oh) And people say my expectations are too high But I’m not asking for the moon  [Chorus: Rae Morris & Both] If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that would do (Ooh, ooh) If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that would do  [Bridge: Tom Odell, Rae Morris & Both] Oh, I'm so sick of laying here So sick of counting tears Comparing everyone to you Oh, oh Oh, I'm so sick of waiting here So frustrated My suspicions are you're laying there and thinking of me too  [Verse 3: Tom Odell, Rae Morris & Both] I learned the lyrics yesterday to all your songs There was one I couldn't do I think the lyric went ""You'll miss me when I'm gone"" But the chords, I was confused I'd ask you ’round and you could tell me where I’m wrong But then I know you'd just refuse Refuse  [Chorus: Tom Odell & Both] If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that would do Oh, oh If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that would do"
  MGMT  ,Congratulations,Dead in the water It's not a paid vacation The sons and daughters of city officials Attend demonstrations It's hardly a sink or swim When all is well if the ticket sells Out with a whimper It's not a blaze of glory You look down from your temple As people endeavor to make it a story And chisel a marble word But all is lost if it's never heard But I've got someone to make reports That tell me how my money's spent To book my stays and draw my blinds So I can't see what's really there And all I need's a great big congratulations I'll keep your dreams You pay attention for me As strange as it seems I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me The ground may be moving fast But I tied my boots to a broken mast The difference is clear You throw it in your cauldron Rust and veneer dusk and dawn Steinways and Baldwins You start with a simple stock of all the waste And salt to taste But damn my luck and damn these friends That keep on combing back their smiles I save my grace with half-assed guilt And lay down the quilt upon the lawn Spread my arms and soak up congratulations

  Eric Benet  ,The Last Time,"The first time I fell in love was long ago. I didn't know how to give my love at all. The next time I settled for what felt so close. But without romance, you're never gonna fall. After everything I've learned; Now it's finally my turn. This is the last time I'll fall... in love. The first time we walked under that starry sky, there was a moment when everything was clear. I didn't need to ask or even wonder why, because each question is answered when your near. and I'm wise enough to know when a miracle unfolds, this is the last time i'll fall in love. Now don't hold back, just let me know. Could i be moving much too fast or way too slow. 'Cause all of my life, I've waited for this day. To find that once in a lifetime, this is it, I'll never be the same. You'll never know what it's taken me to say these words. And now that I've said them, they could never be enough. As far as I can see, there's only you and only me. This is the last time I'll fall in love. Last time i'll fall in love. The last time i'll fall... in love."
  C21  ,When Your Love Is Too Far,"Baby im tired of thinking i was wrong I'm lost with no sign A game with no end  I've been there searching gold but suddenly You played with my mind Got words from behind  A promise is right babe I can believe in some No win by default in your life I'm lost when you're mindless  How can i fall down  Baby when your love is too far Theres no strength in my heart No will leads to distance Can you feel it now Your love is too far I swear but again The silence between us I can feel it now ooh yeah  Baby desire still relies on you Take a look at me now As it still lingers on  You let my feelings grow But honestly I'm through with your game You cant always be right  A promise is sacred I can believe in some With you its a million to one I'm lost cuz you're mindless But how can i fall down  Baby when your love is too far Theres no strength in my heart No will leads to distance Can you feel it now Your love is too far I swear but again The silence between us I can feel it now ooh yeah yeah yeah  Maybe in another life babe I just want it good and real You can beg, steal or lie babe But you dont know when"
