  The Moody Blues  ,For My Lady,"My boat sails stormy seas 나의 보트는 폭풍속의 바다를 항해합니다. Battles oceans filled with tears 눈물로 채워진 대양들을 헤쳐나가지요 At last my port's in view 드디어 저 앞에 항구가 보이고 Now that I've discovered you 나는 당신을 발견했습니다.  Oh I'd give my life so lightly 내 인생을 기꺼이 드리겠어요 For my gentle lady 나의 우아한 여인을 위해 Give it freely and completely 아낌없이 전부 드리겠어요 To my lady 나의 여인에게  As life goes drifting by like a breeze 인생이 미풍처럼 흘러갈 때 She'll gently sigh and slowly bow her head 그녀는 부드럽게 한숨을 내쉬고 고개를 천천히 숙입니다 Then you'll hear her softly cry 그리고 당신은 나지막한 그녀의 울음소리를 들을 수 있어요  Words that you say when we're alone 우리가 외로울 때 당신은 Though actions speak louder than words 말보다는 행동이 효과적이라고 말했습니다만, But all I can say is I love you so To drive away all my hurt 그러나 내가 말할 수 있는 단 하나 당신을 너무 사랑한다는 말입니다.  Set sail towards the sun 태양을 향해 항해하며 Feel the warmth that's just begun 따뜻함을 느낍니다 Share each and every dream 꿈을 나누어요 They belong to everyone 그 꿈들은 모두의 것입니다."

Oh, I'm sorry that you even care  Break these chains and walk without me.   Your eyes are red.  The lie was born, stole our truth  Beneath all your joy, lay my despair.  Behind all these clouds,  There is no sun to raise its head  The love we have left is just yours.   And these pictures can tell lies  And my words will still fall short  And my heart lays disguised  I'm sorry I   Never meant to make you cry  Never meant to make you love me  Now I'm wide awake with open eyes  Lost in all the love that we shared.  Oh, I'm sorry that you even care  Break these chains and walk without me.   All our ways were paved with gold  But built upon the sand  And we could climb above the water  And rest upon the land.  It's up to you, you make the choice  For I could stay if you need  For our home, for your heart.

  Noah & The Whale  ,2 Atoms In A Molecule,"Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind Like 2 atoms in a molecule inseparably combined  But then I woke from the dream to realise I was alone A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne  Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start Oh for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me  And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun If love is just a game how come I've never won I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone"

My feet had left the ground I was floating to heaven But I could only look down My mind was heavy Running ragged with worst case scenarios Emergency exits and the distance below I woke up so worried that the angels let go  Oh God I'm so tired Of being afraid  What would it feel like To put this baggage down If I'm being honest I'm not sure I'd know how I want to take shelter but I'm ready, ready to fight And somewhere in the middle I feel a little paralyzed- But maybe I'm stronger than I realize  I want to believe No, I choose to believe That I was made to become A sanctuary Fear won't go away But I can keep it at bay And these invisible walls Just might keep us safe With vigilant heart I'll push into the dark But I'll learn to breathe deep And make peace with the stars Is that courage or faith To show up every day To trust that there will be light Always waiting behind Even the darkest of nights  And no matter what Somehow we'll be okay Don't be afraid"

  Jamiroquai  ,Light Years (Half The Man),"""People tell me I'm no good Cos I'm expressin' all my sentiments Now I got to channel all my vehemence For the benefit of my self defence And you can be a do gooder But true sincerity ain't charity It can take a life time to be How you wanna be.  You can be light years Away from serious intention And I thought I knew it all Someday I'd get to turn mankind This way If you don't know you can be light years Away from your true destination. No conscious escalation Until I get with good vibration I'm never gonna get to use that use that earthly power Substitutes Can never take the place of peace of mind Losing all sense of direction.  When you're light years Too far away to turn you back on substitution There is no u-turn on a one way route Goin' up when I learn to love the life I can bite the fruit Now I got sunshine in my life.  Light years Never to return to Babylon See money don't make a man But if you really want you get there anyway you can.  """

  Westlife  ,The Rose,Some say love it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love it is a flower And you its only seed  It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul afraid of dying That never learns to live  When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose

I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy before I let you take me home. Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...  We met when we were almost young deep in the green lilac park. You held on to me like I was a crucifix, as we went kneeling through the dark.  Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...  Your letters they all say that you're beside me now. Then why do I feel alone? I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web is fastening my ankle to a stone.  Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...  For now I need your hidden love. I'm cold as a new razor blade. You left when I told you I was curious, I never said that I was brave.  Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...  Oh, you are really such a pretty one. I see you've gone and changed your name again. And just when I climbed this whole mountainside, to wash my eyelids in the rain!  Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ..."

  George Michael  ,They Won`t Go When I Go,No more lying friends Wanting tragic ends Though they do pretend They won't go when I go  All those bleeding hearts With sorrows to impart Were right here from the start And they won't go when I go  And I'll go where I've longed To go so long Away from tears  Gone from painful cries Away from saddened eyes Along with Him I'll bide Because they won't go when I go  Big men feeling small Weak ones standing tall I will watch them fall They won't go when I go  And I'll go where I've longed To go so long Away from tears  Unclean minds mislead the pure The innocent will leave for sure For them there is a resting place People sinning just for fun They will never see the sun For they can never show their faces There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner Who will take more than he will give He ain't hardly gonna give  The greed of man will be Far away from me And my soul will be free They won't go when I go  Since my soul conceived All that I believe The kingdom I will see 'Cause they won't go when I go  When I go where I'll go No one can keep me From my destiny  비참한 종말을 맞이할 위선의 친구들은 더 이상 원하지 않아 그들은 거짓 시늉을 할 뿐 나를 따르지 않을거야  슬픔을 버거워하는 고통스런 마음은 처음부터 바로 여기 존재해왔어 그들은 나를 따르지 않아  내가 원했던 곳으로 갈거야 아주 오래도록... 눈물이 없는 저 먼 곳으로...  고통스런 외침을 떠나 슬픔에 젖은 눈물은 멀리하고 주님과 함께 살겠어 내가 갈 때 그들은 함께 가지 않을 테니까  거물도 소심해질 때가 있고 나약한 사람이 굳건히 버티기도 해 그들이 몰락하는 걸 볼거야 내가 가더라도 그들은 따르지 않을거야  내가 원했던 곳으로 갈거야 아주 오래도록... 눈물이 없는 저 먼 곳으로...  악인(惡人)은 선인(善人)을 오도하고 쉴 곳이 있는 순수한 사람들은 떠나고 말거야 그저 재미로 죄악을 저지르는 사람들은 절대 태양을 볼 수가 없어 얼굴 한번 보인 적이 없는 그들이기에... 아무런 희망도 없고 준 것보다 더 많이 받으려 하는 죄인들에게 내줄 자리는 없어 그들은 절대 베풀려고 하지 않아  탐욕스러운 이는 내게 가까이 올 수 없어 나의 영혼은 자유롭지 하지만 그들은 나를 따라 오지 않을거야  나의 영혼이 나의 믿음을 속였기에 난 하느님의 나라를 택하겠어 그들은 나를 따르지 않을 것이기에...  내가 가야 할 길을 가겠다면 아무도 막을 수 없어 내게 주어진 운명을...

  Carry & Ron  ,I.O.U.,"You believe that I've changed your life forever 당신은 믿고 있어요, 내가 당신의 삶을 영원히 바꾸어 놓았다고 And you're never gonna find another somebody like me 또한 나같은 사람은 다신 찾지 못할것라고 말이죠 And you wish you had more than just a lifetime 그리고 당신은 당신의 수명보다 더 오래 살기를 바라지요. to give back all I've given you 제가 당신에게 베푼 것을 돌려주기 위해서 And that's what you believe 그런데 그것은 당신이 그렇게 믿을 뿐입니다.  But I owe you 하지만 저는 당신께 빚지고 있어요 the sun light in the morning 아침의 햇살과 and the nights of all this loving 이 모든 사랑스런 밤들 that time can't take away 시간이 빼앗아 갈 수 없는 And I owe you 저는 당신께 빚지고 있어요 more than life now, more than ever 현재의 삶 이상의 것을, 그 어느 때 보다도 지금 I know that it's the sweetest debt 그것이 가장 달콤한 빚이라는 것을 알아요 I'll ever have to pay 내가 영원히 갚아야 할  I'm amazed when you say 당신이 말할 때 저는 놀랐어요 it's me you live for 당신이 바로 날 위해 산다고 You know that when I'm holding you 당신은 아시죠, 제가 당신을 포옹하고 있으면 you're right where you belong 당신은 바로 있어야 할 곳에 있다는 것을 And my love, I can't help but smile 당신, 저는 미소를 보내지 않을 수 없습니다. with wonder when you tell me 놀라움으로, 당신이 내게 말할 때 all I've done for you 제가 당신을 위해 한 모든 것을 Cause I've known all alone 왜냐하면 나는 지금까지 혼자만 알고 있었기에"

  Nana Mouskouri  ,The Rose,Some say love it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love it is a flower And you it's only seed It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul afraid of dying That never learns to live When the night has been so lonely And the road has been too long And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snow Lies the seed that with the sun's love In the spring becomes a rose

  A-ha  ,Train Of Thought (Remix) (Remastered Ver.),"He likes to have the morning paper's Crossword solved Words go up words come down Forwards backwards twisted round He grabs a pile of letters from a small suitcase Disappears into an office It's another working day  And his thoughts are full of strangers Corridors of naked lights And his mind once full of reason Now there's more than meets the eye Oh, a stranger's face he carries with him  He likes a bit of reading on the subway home A distant radio whistling tunes that nobody knows At home a house awaits him, He unlocks the door Thinking once there was a sea here But there never was a door  And his thoughts are full of strangers And his eyes to numb to see And nothing that he knows of And nowhere where he's been Was ever quite like this  And his thoughts...  And at heart He's full of strangers Dodging on his train of thought Train of thought"

  Dean Lewis  ,Waves,There is a swelling storm And I'm caught up in the middle of it all And it takes control of the person that I thought I was The boy I used to know But there is a light in the dark And I feel its warmth In my hands in my heart But why can't I hold on 'Cause it comes and goes in waves It always does It always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood Into the flood And the freedom of falling And the feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers And I'm trying hard to let go it comes and goes in waves it comes and goes in waves And carries us away Through the wind Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids Memories of a stolen place Caught in the silence An echo lost in space it comes and goes in waves It always does It always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood Into the flood And the freedom of falling And the feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers And I'm trying hard to let go it comes and goes in waves it comes and goes in waves And carries us away I've watched my wild youth disappear in front of my eyes Moments of magic and wonder It seems so hard to find Is it ever coming back again Is it ever coming back again Take me back to the feeling when Everything was left to find it comes and goes in waves It always does It always does And the freedom of falling And the feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers And I'm trying hard to let go it comes and goes in waves it comes and goes in waves And carries us away
