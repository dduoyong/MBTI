  Ant Saunders  ,MISCOMMUNICATIONS,Miscommunications Can’t ever have no good relations Do I haunt your mind Am I a waste of time Guess I’ll just carry on as a ghost Misinterpretations We’re having differing vibrations I apologize for all my great white lies Where is the time when you need it the most Don’t get your hopes up baby Baby You’re gonna think I’m crazy Crazy Don’t get your hopes up baby Baby You’re gonna think I’m crazy Crazy Woah-oh Fuck your limitations Why let them become regulations Uncontrollably getting so lonely Then swept away down deep through the flume Lowered expectations In every simple situation This is unholy I decay slowly Water me in the fountain of youth Don’t get your hopes up baby Baby You’re gonna think I’m crazy Crazy Don’t get your hopes up baby Baby You’re gonna think I’m crazy Crazy Woah-oh Miscommunications Miscommunications Can’t ever have no good relations Can’t ever have no good relations Miscommunications Do I haunt your mind Am I a waste of time Guess I’ll just carry on as a ghost
  Bread  ,If (Lp Ver.),If a picture paints a thousand words then why can't I paint you The words will never show the you I've come to know if a face could launch thousand ships then where am I to go There's no one home but you You're all that's left me too And when my love for life is running dry you come and pour yourself on me If a man could be two places at one time I'd be with you Tommorrow and today beside you all the way If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die I'd spend the end with you And when the world was through Then one by one the stars would all go out and you and I would simply fly away

  Hall & Oates  ,Out Of Touch,Shake it up is all that we know Using the bodies up as we go Waking up to fantasy The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see Broken ice still melts in the sun And times that are broken can often be one again We're soul alone And soul really matters to me Take a look around You're out of touch I'm out of time But I'm out of my head when you're not around Reaching out for something to hold Looking for a love where the climate is cold Manic moves and drowsy dreams Or living in the middle between the two extremes Smoking guns hot to the touch Would cool down if we didn't use them so much We're soul alone And soul really matters to me Too much

  Toto  ,I`ll Be Over You,ToTo - I'll Be Over You  Some people live their dreams 어떤 사람들은 꿈꾸던 삶을 살고 Some people close their eyes 어떤 사람들은 차라리 눈을 감아버리기도 하죠 Some people's destiny Passes by 또 어떤 사람은 운명을 그냥 지나쳐 버리기도해요  There are no guarantees 어떤 당위도 없어요 There are no alibis 어떤 변명도 없죠  That's how our love must be 그게 우리 사랑이 아니었던가요 Don't ask why 이유는 묻지 말아요..  [Bridge:] It takes some time 시간이 걸릴거예요 God knows how long 하늘만이 그걸 알겠죠 I know that I can forget you 그래도 알아요..당신을 잊을 수 있을 거란 걸  As soon as my heart stops breakin' 내 마음이 더이상 아프지 않을때 Anticipating 기대 조차 하지 않게 될때  As soon as forever is through 영원이 있는 한.. I'll be over you 당신을 잊게 될거예요  Remembering times gone by 추억은 사라지고 Promises we once made 우리가 맺었던 약속들  What are the reasons why 이유가 무엇이던지간에.. Nothing stays the same 그 어느것도 그대로이지 않군요.  [Bridge:] There were the nights holding you close 당신을 안았던 그 밤들 Someday I'll try to forget them 언젠가는 나.. 그 밤들을 잊으려 노력할겁니다.  [Bridge:] Someday I'll be over you 언젠가는 언젠가는.. 당신을 잊게 되겠지요..
