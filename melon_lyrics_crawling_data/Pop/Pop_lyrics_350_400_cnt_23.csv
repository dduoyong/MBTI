  Boy In Space  ,On A Prayer (feat. SHY Martin),I've been dead for days I just feel like a black hole Got my head in space I'm alone where should I go Everything we did is saved in a box full of Polaroids And when I drink I don't think so I call just to say hello Never calling you out Zip a lock on my mouth And I Never figured it out Love just went south And I I wish that I could turn my heart into stone So I don't have to feel what I feel when I'm alone I've been burning pavement Almost met my maker Livin' on a prayer Need to change your face from the screen of my phone Please pick up your stuff so I can finally let you go Called in every favor Devil was my neighbor Livin' on a prayer Guess how many steps that I took Cuz I wanted you to be the one That's how many times I was building you up so you could let me down Now I'm calling you out Rip the lock from my mouth And I I really figured you out Love just went south And I I wish that I could turn my heart into stone So I don't have to feel what I feel when I'm alone I've been burning pavement Almost met my maker Livin' on a prayer Need to change your face from the screen of my phone Please pick up your stuff so I can finally let you go Called in every favor Devil was my neighbor Livin' on a prayer Now I'm calling you out Rip the lock from my mouth And I I really figured you out Love just went south And I I wish I didn't have to feel this low And I don't know if I will make it home To my mama's basement Livin' on a prayer oh

  Eva Cassidy  ,Imagine,"Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying  'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.  But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow  'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.    And if you come, when all the flowers are dying  And I am dead, as dead I well may be  You'll come and find the place where I am lying  And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.    And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me  And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be  If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me  I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.    I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me."
