  Sam Ock  ,Rollercoaster,I wish i could say that I'm a honest human being but what you're really seeing is the truth but times go and change I really don't know what I'm feeling the one thing that I know is that I'm with you I know there's pain 'cause life it ain't so easy and people go and leave you all alone and I can't complain I've been blessed with many things and in the end I know that I'll be home i'll go home let the bad times roll 'cause I'm with you and you're with me let the bad times roll 'cause we're together and that's all that matters to me and I gotta say fellowship in pain is a kind that never fades away which is why i don't fight it I let it come the peace I receive when it's over is a different one from the lack of better words it's intimate a bad time will show me all my pride and it'll murder me you've heard of it right the sound of a soul cry so much louder when there's someone else by its side so my brothers and my sisters when you see it coming the wave of pain stand firm stop your running I think we all agree that it can't be stopped but if we all hold our breath then how can we not share in this connection this empathy so much stronger than our good times though anything personally I think that it's a better day when the light shines and i see the darkness run away let the bad times roll 'cause I'm with you and you're with me let the bad times roll 'cause we're together and that's all that matters to me sometimes they say about the things you're keeping you don't know what you got until it's gone but i'm here to stay of course until i'm leaving 'til life it calls it quits and then i fall i know there's a way to eternity in heaven for i will say that jesus is my truth a smile on my face yes that's what i'll be keeping when all is through ill come home back to you i'll come home back to you let the bad times roll 'cause I'm with you and you're with me let the bad times roll 'cause we're together and that's all that matters to me
  dvsn  ,Can`t Wait,"Perfect timing, something unpredictable You remind me, of someone that I never know  And nobody wants you like I do Nobody feels you like I could Nobody sees you quite the way I do, way I do And nobody treats you like I would And we both know that  Life's too short, let's not waste Any time, we can wait Cause we might find, that there's no time Cause life's too short  There's some situations that turn into relationships, damn Too impatient, I can't sit back and wait for it  Cause nobody wants you like I do Nobody feels you like I could Nobody sees you quite the way I do, way I do And nobody treats you like I would And we both know that  Life's too short, let's not waste Any time, we can wait Cause we might find, that there's no time Cause life's too short You know that Life's too short, let's not waste Any time, we can wait Cause we might find, that there's no time Cause life's too short"
  Alberta Hunter  ,My Handy Man Ain't Handy No More,"Now whoever said a good man is hard to find Positively absolutely sure was blind Cause I just found the best man that ever was And here’s just a few of the things that he does.  He shakes my ashes, Greases my griddle, Churns my butter, And he strokes my fiddle, My man, is such a handy man.  Now he threads my needle, And he creams my wheat, Heats my heater, And he chops my meat (he’s a mess), My man, is such a handy man.  Now I don’t care if you believe it or not, He’s a mighty nice man to have around, Cause when my furnace gets too hot, He’s right there to turn my damper down, For everything, that man of mine’s got a scheme And honey it’s amazing the way he handles my machine My man, is such a handyman (oh that man is a mess).  He flaps my flapjacks, Cleans off the table, Feeds the horses in my stable, My man, is such a handyman.  And do you know, sometimes he’s up way before dawn, Busy cleaning the rough edges off my lawn, My man, is such a handyman.  Now, he never has a single word to say, While he’s working hard (poor soul), And I’d give anything if you could see the way, he handles my front yard.  Now my ice never gets a chance to melt away, Cause he sees that I get a nice fresh piece everyday, My man, is such a handyman."

  IASU  ,Children of the Sun,Children of sun / we were all born as one / and our father commands us / that we all dream for our passions. / Is it finally time? / Can our dreams be realized? / So we brandish our wings of wax and finally take flight. But the sun’s too hot / it’s much too hot. / And as though it were all planned / our wings begin to fall apart. / But the sun’s too hot / it’s much too hot. / And we fall / one by one until there’s none. The sun still shines eternally / as it had done before. / And it shines / and it smiles / and it laughs forever more. And it our minds the skies were ours to seize. / The waters ours to drink / and the air for us to breathe. / But they belong to the stars and the sun / and their open invitation / was just a game for fun.
