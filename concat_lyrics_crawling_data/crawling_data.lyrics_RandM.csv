"  Crosby, Stills & Nash  ",Lady Of The Island,"Holding you close undisturbed before a fire The pressure in my chest when you breathe in my ear We both knew this would happen when you first appeared My lady of the island  The brownness of your body in the fireglow Except the places where the sun refused to go Our bodies were a perfect fit in afterglow we lay My lady of the island  Letting myself wander through the world inside your eyes You know I'd like to stay here until every tear runs dry Do, do, do, do, do, do, do ... My lady of the island  Wrapped around each other in the peeping sun Beams of sunshine light the stage the red light's on I never want to finish what I've just begun with you My lady of the island  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do..."

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore.  2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom. 2 minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb.  The body bags and little rags of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.  The killer's breed or the Demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore.  2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom. 2 minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb.  Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night  Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night"

  Pink Floyd  ,High Hopes (Radio Edit),"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder  [Verse 2] Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  [Instrumental]  [Verse 3] Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been so many times  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river For ever and ever  [Instrumental]  [Outro] ""Is that Charlie?

  This Day And Age  ,Always Straight Ahead,"She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight. She's like a sinking stone, fading from the surface, but we are never alone. She's on a tightrope, losing balance, yet something's pulling her towards hope. I want to run to her, but I've already played that card, so I will fight the urge. Eyes closed, fingers crossed; praying that she's lost... You'll never know what's around the bend. ""Avoid the unknown"" is ringing in your head... She has a fear of love, accepting everything but what she really dreamed of. She keeps her heart locked; no she won't ever answer even though she hears a knock. But love is at the door, and after all isn't that what we are here for? I want to rescue her, but I've already tried, for there is only one cure. (She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight)... While you rest inside your regret, the sun rises and   sets again... You're in your way, that's why you'll always be the same."

  Bon Jovi  ,Keep The Faith,Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know Cause a bottle of vodka still lodged in my head And some blond gave me nightmares I think she's still in my bed As I dream about movies They won't make of me when I'm dead With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head While we're talking About all of the things that I long to believe About love and the truth and what you mean to me And the truth is baby you're all that I need I want to lay you in a bed of roses For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on bed of roses Well I'm so far away That each step that I take is on my way home A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night Just to see through this payphone Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I'll just close my eyes and whisper Baby blind love is true I want to lay you in a bed of roses For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on bed of roses This hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry The barkeeper's wig's crooked And she's giving me the eye I might have said yeah But I laughed so hard I think I died  When you close your eyes Know I'll be thinking about you While my mistress she calls me To stand in her spotlight again Tonite I won't be alone But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove For it's you that I'd die to defend I want to lay you in a bed of roses For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down I want to lay you in a bed of roses For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on bed of roses

This distance in my voice  Isn`t leaving you a choice  So if you`re looking for a time to run away...  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day  They took picture of our dreams  Ran to hide behind the stairs  And said maybe when it`s right  for you, they`ll fall  But if they don`t come down  Resist to need to pull them in  And throw them away  Better to save the mystery  Than surrender to the secret  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day"

  LINKIN PARK  ,In The End (Live At Milton Keynes),It starts with  One thing I don't know why  It doesn't even matter how hard you try  Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  To explain in due time  All I know  time is a valuable thing  Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  Watch it count down to the end of the day  The clock ticks life away  It's so unreal  Didn't look out below  Watch the time go right out the window  Trying to hold on but didn't even know  Wasted it all just to  Watch you go  I kept everything inside and even though I tried  it all fell apart  What it meant to me  will eventually  be a memory  of a time when I tried  so hard    One thing I don't know why  Doesn't even matter how hard you try  Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  To explain in due time  I tried so hard  In spite of the way you were mocking me  Acting like I was part of your property  Remembering all the times you fought with me  I'm surprised it got so far  Things aren't the way they were before  You wouldn't even recognize me anymore  Not that you knew me back then  But it all comes back to me  In the end  You kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart  What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I  I tried so hard  And got so far  But in the end  It doesn't even matter  I had to fall  And lose it all  But in the end  It doesn't even matter  I put my trust in you  Pushed as far as I can go  And for all this  There's only one thing you should know

  Bob Dylan  ,Trying To Get To Heaven,"The air is getting hotter, there's a rumblin' in the skies I've been wading through the high muddy water With the heat risin' in my eyes Every day your memory grows dimmer It dosn't haunt me like it did before I've been walking through the mirror to nowhere Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  When I was in Missouri they would not let me be I had to leave there in a hurry I only saw what they let me see You broke a heart that loved you Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore I've been walkin' that lonesome valley Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  People on the platforms, waitin' for the trains I can hear their hearts a-beatin' Like pendulums swinging on chains When you think that you've lost everything You find out you can always lose a little more I'm just goin' down the road feeling bad Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  I'm goin' down the river, down to New Orleans They tell me everything is gonna be all right But I don't know what all right even means I was ridin' in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore I've been all around the world, boys And I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  Gonna sleep down in the parlor and relive my dreams I close my eyes and I wonder If everything is as hollow as it seems Some trains don't pull no gamblers No midnight ramblers, like they did before I've been to sugar town, I shook the sugar down Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door."
  Beirut  ,A Candle`s Fire,"Oh, light a candle's fire, it carries our good name What would you ask a campfire? It scares me just the same And you, you've had it all along An endless need for games Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame  I hit certain from afar, failed to pull my weight But you were light, we traveled through the fall To arrive at our front gate Tonight, we rest beside the fire A smile upon your face Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame  If I had known, that to carry on that way It wouldn't show in the creases on your face If you should go, would you carry on my name? Just let it blow, and the fog will ? Bishop's flame"
  Maximilian Hecker  ,Rose,I can see the daylight And I feel it's right That she's flowing now She's flowing `til it's through A never-ending darkness A never-ending night Now she flies away To walk upon the clouds  Silly laughing when I come home There's just no reason to call I try to leave you to forget you I try to leave you to love you  Can you hear me singing? Can you see me lying Down on the floor Still laughing like a child? My head is full of voices My head is full of lights So please let me go Please let me run away
  Bastille  ,Pompeii (Kat Krazy Remix),"I was left to my own devices  Many days fell away with nothing to show  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  We were caught up and lost in all of our vices  In your pose as the dust settles around us  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  Oh where do we begin?  The rubble or our sins?  Oh where do we begin?  The rubble or our sins?  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?"

Martha Wainwright),"I find the map and draw a straight line  Over rivers, farms and state lines  The distance from here to where you'd be  It's only finger-lengths that I see    I touch the place  Where I'd find your face  My fingers increases  Of distant dark places    I hang my coat up in the first bar  There is no peace that I've found so far  The laughter penetrates my silence  As drunken men find flaws in science    Their word's mostly noises  Ghosts with just voices  Your words in my memory  Are like music to me    I'm miles from where you are  I lay down on the cold ground  I, I pray that something picks me up  And sets me down in your warm arms    After I have traveled so far  We'd set the fire to the third bar  We'd share each other like an island  Until exhausted, close our eyelids    And dreaming, pick up from  The last place we left off  Your soft skin is weeping  A joy you can't keep in    I'm miles from where you are  I lay down on the cold ground  And I, I pray that something picks me up  And sets me down in your warm arms    And miles from where you are  I lay down on the cold ground  And I, I pray that something picks me up  And sets me down in your warm arms"

  Belle & Sebastian  ,We Were Beautiful,"I was blank as I could be, hearing voices telling me, Walk away from everything Oh I wasn't meant to go, far away from those I know, to some desolate below  We were in the urban scene, where they grind the coffee bean, where the women are oblique And the boys are paper thin, ragged beards upon their chin, we were on the outside looking in Rise above the present day, rise above the popular melee I see you the way you are, I see you the scar  We were beautiful before this went down We were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down We were beautiful before we got wise We were beautiful with sky and blanket laying low  I am hanging on the line, I'm on duty all the time, I am your Samaritan on call I could try my best to heal, all the emptiness you feel, in the giving I will be a light  We were wrapped around our roots, nothing on except our boots, we were intimate around the waist We were settling our scores, we were healing over sores, we were living out the pleasure that we lost  We were beautiful before this went down We were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down We were beautiful for all time and space I will tell it to the sun and I will tell it to  If you listen to the night, we can heard the madmen fight, hear the foxes making out But the people all immune, sleeping silent in their rooms, growing bodies with their sleep Making plans inside their heads, making love to shallow friends  We were beautiful before this went down We were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down We were beautiful before we got wise We were beautiful with sky and blanket fueling up  We were beautiful before this went down We were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down We were beautiful for all time and space I will tell it to the sun and I will tell it to your face"

I'm but a clean man, stable and alone man  Make it so I won't have to try  The faces always stay the same  So I face the fact that I'm just fine  I said that I'm just fine    I remember, head down,  After you had found out  Manna is a hell of a drug  And I need a little more, I think  Because enough is never quite enough  What's enough?    I took it like a grown man crying on the pavement  Hoping you would show your face  But I haven't heard a thing you've said  In at least a couple hundred days  What'd you say?    I was in the front seat, shaking it out  And I was asking if you felt alright  I never want to hear the truth  I want to hear your voice, it sounded fine  My voice, it sounded fine    I could feel my heartbeat taking me down  And for the moment, I would sleep alright  I'm ? with a selfish fear  To keep me up another restless night  Another restless night    The blood was dry, it was sober  The feeling of audible cracks  And I could tell it was over  From the curtains that hung from your neck    And I realized that then you were perfect  And my teeth ripping out of my head  And it looked like a painting I once knew  Back when my thoughts weren't entirely intact    To pray for what I thought were angels  Ended up being ambulances  And the Lord showed me dreams of my daughter  She was crying inside your stomach    And I felt love again"

  Deep Purple  ,April (Part 1),"April is a cruel time  Even though the sun may shine  And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away  Still falls the April rain  And the valley's filled with pain  And you can't tell me quite why  As I look up to the grey sky  Where it should be blue  Grey sky where I should see you  Ask why, why it should be so  I'll cry, say that I don't know    Baby on-ce in a while I'll forget and I'll smile  But then the feeling comes again of an April without end  Of an April lonely as a girl  In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine  But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun  And the springtime's the season of the night    Grey sky where it should be blue  Grey sky where I should see you  Ask why, why it should be so  I'll cry, say that I don't know  I don't know"

You stupid fuck, you need to come back. Oh.  I'm at Arlanda airport with a famous flower in my hand waiting for you. I see the doors open- ing, I see the passengers pouring out fresh like gingerbread cookies and wearing what appears to be new, funky hats, I see from a distance it's someone I know well you're approaching, I can see it, I take a step forward."

  David Bowie  ,The Width Of A Circle (2015 Remastered Ver.),"In the corner of the morning in the past I would sit and blame the master first and last All the roads were straight and narrow And the prayers were small and yellow And the rumour spread that I was aging fast Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree And I looked and frowned and the monster was me  Well, I said hello and I said hello And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know."" So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN"" So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through For I realized that God's a young man too  So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye"" And I smashed my soul and traded my mind Got laid by a young bordello I was vaguely half asleep For which my reputation swept back home in drag And the moral of this magic spell Negotiates my hide When God did take my logic for a ride (Riding along)  He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again"" (Turn around,go back!)  He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said ""Do it again, do it again"" (Turn around,go back!)  His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said ""Do it again, do it again"" (Turn around, go back!)  Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

  Neil Young  ,Are You Passionate?,"Are you passionate? Are you livin' like you talk? Are you dreamin' now that you're goin' to the top? Are you negative, In a world that never stops, Turnin' on you? Turnin' on me? Turnin' on you?  Are you loving it? Can you ever get enough of it? Is it everything? A love that never stops, Comin' to you? Comin' to me? Comin' to you?  Once I was a soldier, I was fighting in the sky, And the gunfire kept comin' back on me. So I dove into the darkness, And I let my missles fly. And they might be the ones, That kept you free.  Once I was a prisoner, I was riding in a truck, Cleaned up for public display. I looked at those around me, And when they looked at me, I let them see my soul that day.  Are you scared of it?

  Judas Priest  ,Lochness,Grey mist drifts upon the water The mirrored surface moves Awakened of this prescence Dispelling legends proof  A beastly head of onyx With eyes set coals of fire It's leathered hide Glides glistening Ascends the heathered briar  This legend lives Through centuries Evoking history's memories Prevailing in eternities on and on and on  Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress Malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me  Somehow it heeds the piper From battlements that call From side to side it ponders Impassioned in the skirl  This highland lair of mystery Retains a lost world's empathy Resiliant to discovery on and on and on  This legend lives Through centuries Evoking history's memories Prevailing in eternity Your secret lies safe with me  This creatures peril from decease Implores to mankind for release A legacy to rest in peace and on and on and on

  Ed Sheeran  ,Take It Back,"I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten Cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm Prisoner with a vision Signs of a label But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't So perk your ears up and listen Studio is a system And you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga We drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I do my own thing now And get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded Like a paper weight At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked Went from sleeping at a subway station To sleeping with a movie star And adding to the population Not my imagination I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax I take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack I'll be singing the news Tryin' act like Jack Black When I bring it to school I make a beat with my feet By just hittin' the loop Bringing the lyrics to prove That I can fit in these shoes I give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene Like an opal fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering everything that happens Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song Since they are claiming I handled it wrong But then I've never had an enemy Except the NME but I'll be selling Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be With only spectacles ahead of me And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet I take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No And take it back now  Now I don't ever wanna be perfect Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking absinth can change your mind state Vividly need to let my liver be And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that how it's supposed to be I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams But, but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out It's time to take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  Mmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No My dreams keep me awake at night Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype Am I just living the lie With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake But the other 10 per cent it never fades Dreaming dreams, day to day goals Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up And just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me buskin' on the street When it was cold outdoors And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it Never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams you own, just set your goals And have the utmost faith in it tread your own path You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha"

And then you spat right in our face. A mouth open, flies ascending A paradise of empty souls The black skies an empty ocean It took the wink of an eye For our pleasant tree of knowledge A long shadow touches death Lose sight of a broken promise And in a moment nothingness descends Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond"""

  Santana  ,Samba Pa Ti,"Samba Pa Ti is a song that I wrote when we came back from Europe the very first time. I was up in my room looking out my window because I heard this sound. This cat blew a couple of notes on the saxophone in the back of the alley.  And when I looked out, he was trying to stay up on his feet. It looked like the whole world was moving around him. And he was trying to decide between putting his saxophone in his mouth and putting the bottle of booze from his back pocket into his mouth.  And I thought ""he is a prisoner."" He didn't know what to put in his mouth next - the horn or the bottle of booze, you know. And it just hit me. It really broke me down because he looked like all of us at one time or another.  And for some reason, i just heard these lyrics, ""through every step in life you find freedom from within."" And then I heard the melody.  It was one of the first songs that I felt really free, free enough to forget about anything. You just let it flow through you. And even though it's very simple, there's still a lot of emotion in it."

How we are just drunken fools, Going broke, breaking the rules, I think we need another drink, Or is it just me? Is it just me?  Took the wheel and lost control, Need somebody else to do the driving.

  Marketa Irglova  ,We Are Good,Early morning rising with the sun Resting where the sky meets the earth Feeling the first rays of sunlight reaching into my soul Where they reinstate the sense of my own self worth If you're not good you're bad That's far too black and white Behold the glorious sun in all its radiance bright It too at times is obscured by the thick blue veil of night Still the moon and all the stars combine to reflect it's light And so it is that we are good Though we do not always do as we should We lose track of right and wrong And we're not always standing strong But still don't you wanna believe In things that eyes do not perceive Like our light shining from within That in a battle with our darkness can win The gates of heaven open up before me As my heart is given wings and flies Leaving all pretense behind everything is crystal clear Even the worry of uncertainty subsides They say that time will come for us to be reborn Into the newness of unity that has been torn Into duality into it's us against them It's from a place of fear that all our conflicts stem We're almost there but not yet still the stage is set For the play we may enact according to our contract That we may both you and I with everybody in our home up high To awaken from our deep and long undisturbed though hardly peaceful sleep If to look is to know the grace which you bestow Upon those that you would raise into a kind and loving gaze Then to look is to see everyone as good as they can be

  Eric Clapton  ,Old Love,"I can feel your body When I'm lying in bed There's too much confusion Going around through my head  And it makes me so angry To know that the flame still burns Why can't I get over? When will I ever learn?  Old love, leave me alone Old love, go on home  I can see your face But I know that it's not real It's just an illusion Caused by how I used to feel  And it makes me so angry To know that the flame will always burn I'll never get over I know now that I'll never learn  Chorus"
  U2  ,Do You Feel Loved,Take these hands they're good for nothing You know these hands have never worked a day Take these boots they're going nowhere You know these boots they don't want to stray You got my head filled with songs You got my shoelaces undone Take my shirt go on take it off me You can tear it up If you can tie me down Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?  Take the colours of my imagination Take the scent hanging in the air Take this tangle of a coversation And turn it into your own prayer With my fingers as you want them With my nails under your hide With my teeth at your back And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?  Love's a bully pushing shoving In the belly of a woman Heavy rhythm taking over To stick together A man and a woman Stick together Man and woman Stick together ... Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved? And it looks like the sun But it feels like the rain And there's heat in the sun To see us through the rain Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?

  Oasis  ,Don`t Look Back In Anger (Remastered),Slip inside the eye of your mind Don't you know you might find A better place to play You said that you'd never been But All the things that you've seen Will slowly fade away So I'll start the revolution from my bed Cos you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait she knows it's too late as we're walking on by Her soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows if it's night or day Please don't put your life in the hands Of a Rock n Roll band Who'll throw it all away Gonna start the revolution from my bed 'Coz you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside 'coz summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace take that look from off your face 'Coz you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait She knows it's too late as she's walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can wait She knows it's too late as we're walking on by Her soul slides away But don't look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can wait She knows it's too late as she's walking on by My soul slides away But don't look back in anger don't look back in anger I heard you say at least not today
